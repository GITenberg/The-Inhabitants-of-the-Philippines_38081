<h2 class="main">Preface.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The writer feels that no English book does justice to
the natives of the Philippines, and this conviction has impelled him to
publish his own more favourable estimate of them. He arrived in Manila
with a thorough command of the Spanish language, and soon acquired a
knowledge of the Tagal dialect. His avocations brought him into contact
with all classes of the community&mdash;officials, priests,
land-owners, mechanics, and peasantry: giving him an unrivalled
opportunity to learn their ideas and observe their manners and customs.
He resided in Luzon for fourteen years, making trips either on business
or for sport all over the Central and Southern Provinces, also visiting
Ceb&uacute;, Iloilo, and other ports in Visayas, as well as Calamianes,
Cuyos, and Palawan.</p>
<p>Old Spanish chroniclers praise the good breeding of the natives, and
remark the quick intelligence of the young.</p>
<p>Recent writers are less favourable; Ca&ntilde;amaque holds them up
to ridicule, Monteverde denies them the possession of any good quality
either of body or mind.</p>
<p>Foreman declares that a voluntary concession of justice is regarded
by them as a sign of weakness; other writers judge them from a few
days&rsquo; experience of some of the cross-bred corrupted denizens of
Manila.</p>
<p>Mr. Whitelaw Reid denounces them as rebels, savages, and treacherous
barbarians.</p>
<p>Mr. McKinley is struck by their ingratitude for American kindness
and mercy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e198" href="#xd20e198"
name="xd20e198">vi</a>]</span></p>
<p>Senator Beveridge declares that the inhabitants of Mindanao are
incapable of civilisation.</p>
<p>It seems to have been left to French and German contemporary
writers, such as Dr. Montano and Professor Blumentritt to show a more
appreciative, and the author thinks, a fairer spirit, than those who
have requited the hospitality of the Filipinos by painting them in the
darkest colours. It will be only fair to exempt from this censure two
American naval officers, Paymaster Wilcox and Mr. L. S. Sargent, who
travelled in North Luzon and drew up a report of what they saw.</p>
<p>As regards the accusation of being savages, the Tagals can claim to
have treated their prisoners of war, both Spaniards and Americans with
humanity, and to be fairer fighters than the Boers.</p>
<p>The writer has endeavoured to describe the people as he found them.
If his estimate of them is more favourable than that of others, it may
be that he exercised more care in declining to do business with, or to
admit to his service natives of doubtful reputation; for he found his
clients punctual in their payments, and his employ&eacute;s, workmen
and servants, skilful, industrious, and grateful for benefits
bestowed.</p>
<p>If the natives fared badly at the hands of recent authors, the
Spanish Administration fared worse, for it has been painted in the
darkest tints, and unsparingly condemned.</p>
<p>It was indeed corrupt and defective, and what government is not?
More than anything, it was behind the age, yet it was not without its
good points.</p>
<p>Until an inept bureaucracy was substituted for the old paternal
rule, and the revenue quadrupled by increased taxation, the Filipinos
were as happy a community as could be found in any colony. The
population greatly multiplied; they lived in competence, if not in
affluence; cultivation was extended, and the exports steadily
increased.</p>
<p>The natives were secured the perpetual usufruct of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e216" href="#xd20e216" name=
"xd20e216">vii</a>]</span>land they tilled, they were protected against
the usurer, that curse of East and West.</p>
<p>In guaranteeing the land to the husbandman, the &ldquo;Laws of the
Indies&rdquo; compare favourably with the law of the United States
regarding Indian land tenure. The Supreme Court in 1823 decided that
&ldquo;discovery gives the dominion of the land discovered to the
States of which the discoverers were the subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been almost an axiom with some writers that no advance was
made or could be made under Spanish rule.</p>
<p>There were difficulties indeed. The Colonial Minister, importuned on
the one hand by doctrinaire liberals, whose crude schemes of reform
would have set the Archipelago on fire, and confronted on the other by
the serried phalanx of the Friars with their hired literary bravos, was
very much in the position of being between the devil and the deep sea,
or, as the Spaniards phrase it &ldquo;<span lang="es">entre la espada y
la pared</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even thus the Administration could boast of some reforms and
improvements.</p>
<p>The hateful slavery of the Cagayanes had been abolished; the forced
cultivation of tobacco was a thing of the past, and in all the
Archipelago the <i>corv&eacute;e</i> had been reduced.</p>
<p>A telegraph cable connecting Manila with Hong Kong and the
world&rsquo;s telegraph system had been laid and subsidized. Telegraph
wires were extended to all the principal towns of Luzon; lines of mail
steamers to all the principal ports of the Archipelago were established
and subsidized. A railway <span class="measure" title=
"193 kilometers">120 miles</span> long had been built from Manila to
Dagupan under guarantee. A steam tramway had been laid to Malabon, and
horse tramways through the suburbs of Manila. The Quay walls of the
Pasig had been improved, and the river illuminated from its mouth to
the bridge by powerful electric arc lights.</p>
<p>Several lighthouses had been built, others were in progress. A
capacious harbour was in construction, although unfortunately defective
in design and execution. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e241" href=
"#xd20e241" name="xd20e241">viii</a>]</span>The Manila waterworks had
been completed and greatly reduced the mortality of the city. The
schools were well attended, and a large proportion of the population
could read and write. Technical schools had been established in Manila
and Iloilo, and were eagerly attended. Credit appears to be due to the
Administration for these measures, but it is rare to see any mention of
them.</p>
<p>As regards the Religious Orders that have played so important a part
scarcely a word has been said in their favour. Worcester declares his
conviction that their influence is wholly bad. However they take a lot
of killing and seem to have got round the Peace Commission and General
Otis.</p>
<p>They are not wholly bad, and they have had a glorious history. They
held the islands from 1570 to 1828, without any permanent garrison of
Spanish regular troops, and from 1828 to 1883 with about 1500
artillerymen. They did <span class="corr" id="xd20e248" title=
"Source: no">not</span> entirely rely upon brute force. They are
certainly no longer suited to the circumstances of the Philippines
having survived their utility. They are an anachronism. But they have
brought the Philippines a long way on the path of civilisation. Let us
be just; what British, French, or Dutch colony, populated by natives,
can compare with the Philippines as they were till 1895?</p>
<p>And what about American rule? It has begun unfortunately, and has
raised a feeling of hatred in the natives that will take a generation
to efface. It will not be enough for the United States to beat down
armed resistance. A huge army must be maintained to keep the natives
down. As soon as the Americans are at war with one of the Great Powers,
the natives will rise; whenever a land-tax is imposed there will be an
insurrection.</p>
<p>The great difference between this war and former insurrections is
that now for the first time the natives have rifles and ammunition, and
have learned to use them. Not all the United States Navy can stop them
from bringing in fresh supplies. Unless some arrangement is come to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd20e255" href="#xd20e255" name=
"xd20e255">ix</a>]</span>with the natives, there can be no lasting
peace. Such an arrangement I believe quite possible, and that it could
be brought about in a manner satisfactory to both parties.</p>
<p>This would not be, however, on the lines suggested in the
<i>National Review</i> of September under the heading, &ldquo;Will the
United States withdraw from the Philippines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three centuries of Spanish rule is not a fit preparation for
undertaking the government of the Archipelago. But Central and Southern
Luzon, with the adjacent islands, might be formed into a State whose
inhabitants would be all Tagals and Vicols, and the northern part into
another State whose most important peoples would be the Pampangos, the
Pangasinanes, the Ilocanos, and the Cagayanes; the Igorrotes and other
heathen having a special Protector to look after their interests.</p>
<p>Visayas might form a third State, all the inhabitants being of that
race, whilst Mindanao and Southern Palawan should be entirely governed
by Americans like a British Crown Colony.</p>
<p>The Sulu Sultanate could be a Protectorate similar to North Borneo
or the Malay States. Manila could be a sort of Federal District, and
the Consuls would be accredited to the President&rsquo;s
representative, the foreign relations being solely under his direction.
There should be one tariff for all the islands, for revenue only,
treating all nations alike, the custom houses, telegraphs, post
offices, and lighthouse service being administered by United States
officials, either native or American. With power thus limited, the
Tagals, Pampangos, and Visayas might be entrusted with their own
affairs, and no garrisons need be kept, except in certain selected
healthy spots, always having transports at hand to convey them wherever
they were wanted. If, as seems probable, Mr. McKinley should be
re-elected, I hope he will attempt some such arrangement, and I
heartily wish him success in pacifying this sorely troubled country,
the scene of four years continuous massacre. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd20e268" href="#xd20e268" name=
"xd20e268">x</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Archipelago is at present in absolute anarchy, the exports have
diminished by half, and whereas we used to travel and camp out in
absolute security, now no white man dare show his face more than a mile
from a garrison.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, some supporters of the Administration in the
States are advising young men with capital that there is a great
opening for them as planters in the Islands.</p>
<p>There may be when the Islands are pacified, but not before.</p>
<p>To all who contemplate proceeding to or doing any business, or
taking stock in any company in the Philippines, I recommend a careful
study of my book. They cannot fail to benefit by it.</p>

<p class="first">The Philippine Archipelago, in which I include the
Sulu group, lies entirely within the northern tropic; the southernmost
island of the Tawi-tawi group called Sibutu reaches down to 4&deg;
38&prime; N., whilst Yami, the northernmost islet of the Batanes group,
lies in 21&deg; 7&prime; N. This gives an extreme length of
<span class="measure" title="1770 kilometers">1100 miles</span>, whilst
the extreme breadth is about <span class="measure" title=
"1094 kilometers">680 miles</span>, measured a little below the 8th
parallel from the Island of Bal&aacute;bac to the east coast of
Mindanao.</p>
<p>Various authorities give the number of islands and islets at 1200
and upwards; many have probably never been visited by a white man. We
need only concern ourselves with the principal islands and those
adjacent to them.</p>
<p>From the hydrographic survey carried out by officers of the Spanish
Navy, the following areas have been calculated and are considered
official, except those marked with an asterisk, which are only
estimated.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Lest I should be taxed with exaggeration when I record
my impressions of the beauty and potential wealth of the Archipelago,
so far as I have seen it; I shall commence by citing the opinions of
some who, at different times, have visited the islands.</p>
<p>I think I cannot do better than give precedence to the impressions
of two French gentlemen who seem to me to have done justice to the
subject, then cite the calm judgment of a learned and sagacious Teuton,
and lastly quote from the laboured paragraphs of a much-travelled
cosmopolite, at one time Her Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s Consul at
Manila.</p>
<p>Monsieur Dumont D&rsquo;Urville says: &ldquo;The Philippines, and
above all Luzon, have nothing in this world to equal them in climate,
beauty of landscape, and fertility of soil. Luzon is the finest diamond
that the Spanish adventurers have ever found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has remained uncut in their hands; but deliver over Luzon
to British activity and tolerance, or else to the laborious tenacity of
the Dutch Creoles, and you will see what will come out of this
marvellous gem.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3"
name="pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>Monsieur de Guignes says: &ldquo;Of the numerous colonies belonging
to the Spaniards, as one of the most important must indisputably be
reckoned the Philippines. Their position, their great fertility, and
the nature of their productions, render them admirably adapted for
active commerce, and if the Spaniards have not derived much benefit
from them, to themselves and to their manner of training is the fault
to be ascribed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herr Jagor, speaking of the Province of Bulacan, says the roads were
good and were continuously shaded by fruit trees, cocoa and areca
palms, and the aspect of this fruitful province reminded him of the
richest districts in Java, but he found the <i>pueblos</i> here
exhibited more comfort than the <i>desas</i> there.</p>
<p>Mr. Gifford Palgrave says: &ldquo;Not the &AElig;gean, not the West
Indian, not the Samoan, not any other of the fair island clusters by
which our terraqueous planet half atones for her dreary expanses of
grey ocean and monotonous desert elsewhere, can rival in manifold
beauties of earth, sea, sky, the Philippine Archipelago; nor in all
that Archipelago, lovely as it is through its entire extent, can any
island vie with the glories of Luzon.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">If I may without presumption add my testimony to that
of these illustrious travellers, I would say that, having been over a
great part of South America, from Olinda Point to the Straits of
Magellan, from Tierra del Fuego to Panama, not only on the coasts but
in the interior, from the Pampas of the Argentine and the swamps of the
Gran Chaco to where</p>

<p class="first">having traversed the fairest gems of the Antilles and
seen some of the loveliest landscapes in Japan, I know of no land more
beautiful than Luzon, certainly of none possessing more varied features
or offering more striking contrasts.</p>
<p>Limestone cliffs and pinnacles, cracked and hollowed into
labyrinthine caves, sharp basalt peaks, great ranges of mountains,
isolated volcanic cones, cool crystalline springs, jets of boiling
water, cascades, rivers, lakes, swamps, narrow <span class=

<h3 class="main">Vegetation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Vegetation here runs riot, hardly checked by the
devastating typhoon, or the fall of volcanic ashes. From the cocoa-nut
palm growing on the coral strand, from the mangrove, building its
pyramid of roots upon the ooze, to the giant bamboo on the banks of the
streams, and the noble mango tree adorning the plains, every tropical
species flourishes in endless variety, and forests of conifers<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1928src" href="#xd20e1928" name="xd20e1928src">2</a>
clothe the summits of the Zambales and Ilocan mountains.</p>
<p>As for the forest wealth, the trees yielding indestructible timber
for ships, houses or furniture, those giving valuable drugs and healing
oils, gums and pigments, varnishes, pitch and resin, dyes, sap for
fermenting or distilling, oil for burning, water, vinegar, milk, fibre,
charcoal, pitch, fecula, edible fungi, tubers, bark and fruits, it
would take a larger book than this to enumerate them in their
incredible variety.</p>
<div class="div3 subsection">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Mango Trees.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A notable feature of the Philippine landscape is the
mango tree. This truly magnificent tree is often of perfect symmetry,
and rears aloft on its massive trunk and wide-spreading branches a
perfect dome of green and glistening leaves, adorned in season with
countless strings of sweet-scented blossom and pendent clusters of
green and golden fruit, incomparably luscious, unsurpassed,
unequalled.</p>
<p>Beneath that shapely vault of verdure the feathered tribes find
shelter. The restless mango bird<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1940src"
href="#xd20e1940" name="xd20e1940src">3</a> displays his contrasted
plumage of black and yellow as he flits from bough to bough, the
crimson-breasted pigeon and the ring-dove rest secure.</p>
<p>These glorious trees are pleasing objects for the eye to rest on.
All through the fertile valleys of Luzon they stand singly or in
groups, and give a character to the landscape which would otherwise be
lacking. Only the largest and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href=
"#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>finest English oaks can compare with the
mango trees in appearance; but whilst the former yield nothing of
value, one or two mango trees will keep a native family in comfort and
even affluence with their generous crop.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 subsection">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">Bamboos.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the banks of the Philippine streams and rivers that
giant grass, the thorny bamboo, grows and thrives. It grows in clumps
of twenty, forty, fifty stems. Starting from the ground, some four to
six inches in diameter, it shoots aloft for perhaps seventy feet,
tapering to the thickness of a match at its extremity, putting forth
from each joint slender and thorny branches, carrying small, thin, and
pointed leaves, so delicately poised as to rustle with the least breath
of air.</p>
<p>The canes naturally take a gradual curve which becomes more and more
accentuated as their diameter diminishes, until they bend over at their
tops and sway freely in the breeze.</p>
<p>I can only compare a fine clump of bamboos to a giant plume of green
ostrich feathers. Nothing in the vegetable kingdom is more graceful,
nothing can be more useful. Under the blast of a typhoon the bamboo
bends so low that it defies all but the most sudden and violent gusts.
If, however, it succumbs, it is generally the earth under it that gives
way, and the whole clump falls, raising its interlaced roots and a
thick wall of earth adhering to and embraced by them.</p>
<p>Piercing the hard earth, shoving aside the stones with irresistible
force, comes the new bamboo, its head emerging like a giant
artichoke.</p>
<p>Each flinty-headed shoot soars aloft with a rapidity astonishing to
those who have only witnessed the tardy growth of vegetation in the
temperate zone. I carefully measured a shoot of bamboo in my garden in
Santa Ana and found that it grew two feet in three days, that is, eight
inches a day, &#8531; inch per hour. <i>I could see it grow.</i> When I
commenced to measure the shoot it was eighteen inches high and was four
inches in diameter. This rapid growth, which, considering the
extraordinary usefulness of the bamboo ought to excite man&rsquo;s
gratitude to Almighty Providence, has, to the shame of human nature,
led the Malay and the Chinaman to utilise the bamboo to inflict death
by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>hideous torture on his fellow men. (See T&ucirc;kang
B&ucirc;rok&rsquo;s story in Hugh Clifford&rsquo;s &lsquo;Studies of
Brown Humanity.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>Each joint is carefully enveloped by nature in a wrapper as tough as
parchment, covered, especially round the edges, with millions of small
spines. The wrapper, when dry, is brown, edged with black, but when
fresh the colours are remarkable, pale yellow, dark yellow, orange,
brown, black, pale green, dark green, black; all shaded or contrasted
in a way to make a Parisian dress designer feel sick with envy.</p>
<p>This wrapper does not fall off till the joint has hardened and
acquired its flinty armour so as to be safe from damage by any
animal.</p>
<p>It would take a whole chapter to enumerate the many and varied uses
of the bamboo.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that I cannot conceive how the Philippine native
could do without it.</p>
<p>Everlastingly renewing its youth, perpetually soaring to the sky,
proudly overtopping all that grows, splendidly flourishing when meaner
plants must fade from drought, this giant grass, which delights the
eyes, takes rank as one of God&rsquo;s noblest gifts to tropical
man.</p>

<p class="first">The supreme head of the administration was a
Governor-General or Captain-General of the Philippines. The British
Colonial Office has preserved this Spanish title in Jamaica where the
supreme authority is still styled Captain-General and
Governor-in-Chief.</p>
<p>In recent years no civilian has been Governor-General of the
Philippines, the appointment being given or sold to a
Lieutenant-General, though in 1883 a Field-Marshal was sent out. But in
1874 Rear-Admiral Malcampo obtained the post, and a very weak and
foolish Governor-General he turned out to be.</p>
<p>In former times military men did not have a monopoly of such posts,
and civilians, judges, priests, and bishops have held this
appointment.</p>
<p>The Governor-General had great powers. Practically, if not legally,
he had the power of life and death, for he could proclaim martial law
and try offenders by court-martial. He was <i>ex officio</i> president
of every corporation or commission, and he could expel from the Islands
any person, whether Spaniard, native, or foreigner, by a decree
declaring that his presence was inconvenient.</p>

<p class="first">He could suspend or remove any official, and in fact
was almost despotic. On the other hand he had to remember two important
limitations. Unless he supported the religious orders against all
comers he would have the Procurators of these wealthy corporations, who
reside in Madrid, denouncing him to the Ministry as an anti-clerical,
and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>freemason, and perhaps offering a heavy bribe for
his removal. If he made an attempt to put down corruption and
embezzlement in the Administration, his endeavours would be thwarted in
every possible way by the officials, and a formidable campaign of
calumny and detraction would be inaugurated against him. The
appointment was for a term of three years at a salary of $40,000 per
annum, and certain very liberal travelling allowances.</p>
<p>Since the earthquake of 1863 the official residence of the
Governors-General was at Malaca&ntilde;an, on the River Pasig in the
ward of San Miguel. This is now the residence of the American Governor.
He had a troop of native Lancers to escort him when he drove out, and a
small corps of Halberdiers for duty within the palace and grounds.
These latter wore a white uniform with red facings, and were armed with
a long rapier and a halberd. They were also furnished with rifles and
bayonets for use in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>When the Governor-General drove out, every man saluted him by
raising his hat&mdash;and when he went to the Cathedral he was received
by the clergy at the door, and, on account of being the Vice-Regal
Patron, was conducted under a canopy along the nave to a seat of
honour.</p>
<p>His position was in fact one of great power and dignity, and it was
felt necessary to surround the representative of the king with much
pomp and state in order to impress the natives with his importance and
authority.</p>
<p>There was a Governor-General of Visayas who resided at Cebu, and was
naturally subordinate to the Governor-General of the Philippines. He
was usually a Brigadier-General.</p>
<p>In case of the death or absence of the Governor-General, the
temporary command devolved upon the Segundo Cabo, a general officer in
immediate command of the military forces. Failing him, the Acting
Governor-Generalship passed to the Admiral commanding the station.</p>
<p>The two principal departments of the administration were the
Intendencia or Treasury, and the Direction of Civil Administration.</p>
<p>The Archipelago is divided into fifty-one provinces or districts,
according to the accompanying table and map. <span class=

<p>The above figures are taken from the official census of 1877.</p>
<p>This is the latest I have been able to find.</p>
<p>In the Appendix is given an estimate of the population in 1890, the
author puts the number at 8,000,000, and at this date there may well be
9,000,000 inhabitants in the Philippines and Sulus.</p>
<p>It will be seen that these provinces are of very different extent,
and vary still more in population, for some have only a few hundred
inhabitants, whilst others, for instance, Ceb&uacute; and Ilo-Ilo have
half-a-million.</p>
<p>Each province was under a Governor, either civil or military. Those
provinces which were entirely pacified had Civil Governors, whilst
those more liable to disturbance or attack from independent tribes or
from the Moors had Military Governors. Up to 1886 the pacified
provinces were governed by Alcaldes-Mayores, who were both governors
and judges. An appeal from their decisions could be made to the
Audiencia or High Court at Manila.</p>
<p>From the earliest times of their appointment, the Alcaldes were
allowed to trade. Some appointments carried the right to trade, but
most of the Alcaldes had to covenant to forego a large proportion of
their very modest stipends in order to obtain this privilege. By trade
and by the fees and <i>squeezes</i> of their law courts they usually
managed to amass fortunes. In 1844 the Alcaldes were finally prohibited
from trading.</p>
<p>This was a rude system of government, but it was cheap, and a
populous province might only have to maintain half-a-dozen
Spaniards.</p>
<p>Each town has its municipality consisting of twelve <i lang=
"es">principales</i>, all natives, six are chosen from those who have
already been Gobernadorcillos. They are called past-captains, and
correspond to aldermen who have passed the chair. The other six are
chosen from amongst the Barangay headmen. From these twelve are elected
all the officials, the Gobernadorcillo or Capitan, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
lieutenants, the <i lang="es">alguaciles</i> (constables), the judges
of the fields, of cattle, and of police. The Capitan appoints and pays
the directorcillo or town clerk, who attends to the routine
business.</p>
<p>For the maintenance of order, and for protecting the town against
attack, there is a body of local police called <i lang=
"es">Cuadrilleros</i>. These are armed with bolos and lances in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>the smaller and poorer towns, but in more
important places they have fire-arms usually of obsolete pattern. But
in towns exposed to Moro attack the cuadrilleros are more numerous, and
carry Remington rifles.</p>
<p>The Gobernadorcillos of towns were directly responsible to the
governor of the province, the governor in case of emergency reported
direct to the Governor-General, but for routine business through the
Director-General of Civil Administration, which embraced the
departments of Public Works, Inspection of Mines and Forests, Public
Instruction, Model Farms, etc.</p>
<p>The collection of taxes was under the governors of provinces
assisted by delegates of the Intendant-General. It was directly
effected by the Barangay headman each of whom was supposed to answer
for fifty families, the individuals of which were spoken of as his
<i lang="es">s&aacute;copes</i>. His eldest son was recognised as his
chief assistant, and he, like his father, was exempt from the tribute
or capitation tax.</p>
<p>The office was hereditary, and was not usually desired, but like the
post of sheriff in an English county it had to be accepted nolens
volens.</p>
<p>No doubt a great deal of latitude was allowed to the Barangay Chiefs
in order that they might collect the tax, and the stick was often in
requisition. In fact the chiefs had to pay the tax somehow, and it is
not surprising that they took steps to oblige their
<i>s&aacute;copes</i> to pay.</p>
<p>I, however, in my fourteen years&rsquo; experience, never came
across such a case as that mentioned by Worcester, p. 295, where he
states that in consequence of a deficiency of $7000, forty-four headmen
of Siquijor were seized and exiled, their lands, houses and cattle
confiscated, and those dependent on them left to shift for themselves.
The amount owing by each headman was under $160 Mexican, equal to $80
gold, and it would not take much in the way of lands, houses, and
cattle to pay off this sum. However, it is true that Siquijor is a poor
island. But on page 284 he maintains that the inhabitants of Siquijor
had plenty of money to back their fighting-cocks, and paid but little
attention to the rule limiting each man&rsquo;s bet on one fight to
$50. From this we may infer that they could find money to bet with, but
not to pay their taxes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=

<h3 class="main">Collection of Taxes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Natives of the gorgeous East very commonly require a
little persuasion to make them pay their taxes, and I have read of
American millionaires who, in the absence of this system, could not be
got to pay at all. Not many years ago, there was an enquiry as to
certain practices resorted to by native tax-collectors in British India
to induce the poor Indian to pay up; anybody who is curious to know the
particulars can hunt them up in the Blue Books&mdash;they are
unsuitable for publication.</p>
<p>In Egypt, up to 1887, or thereabouts, the
&ldquo;courbash&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2583src" href=
"#xd20e2583" name="xd20e2583src">1</a> was in use for this purpose. I
quote from a speech by Lord Cromer delivered about that time
(&rsquo;Lord Cromer,&rsquo; by H. D. Traill): &ldquo;The courbash used
to be very frequently employed for two main objects, viz.: the
collection of taxes, and the extortion of evidence. I think I may say
with confidence that the use of the courbash as a general practice in
connection either with collection of taxes or the extortion of evidence
has ceased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we need not go so far East for examples of collecting taxes by
means of the stick. The headmen of the village communities in Russia
freely apply the lash to recalcitrant defaulters.</p>
<p>It would seem, therefore, that the Spaniards erred in company with
many other nations. It was by no means an invention of theirs, and it
will be remembered that some of our early kings used to persuade the
Jews to pay up by drawing their teeth.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Government and the laws partook of a patriarchal
character, and notwithstanding certain exactions, the Spanish officials
and the natives got on very well together. The Alcaldes remained for
many years in one province, and knew all the principal people
intimately. I doubt if there was any colony in the world where as much
intercourse took place between the governors and the natives, certainly
not in any British colony, nor in British India, where the gulf ever
widens. In this case, governors and governed professed the same
religion, and no caste distinctions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13"
href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>prevailed to raise a barrier
between them. They could worship together, they could eat together, and
marriages between Spaniards and the daughters of the native landowners
were not unfrequent. These must be considered good points, and although
the general corruption and ineptitude of the administration was
undeniable, yet, bad as it was, it must be admitted that it was
immeasurably superior to any government that any Malay community had
ever established. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14"

<h3 class="main">Moriones.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During my residence in the Islands&mdash;from 1877 to
1892&mdash;there were six Governors-General, and they differed very
widely in character and ideas.</p>
<p>The first was Don Domingo Moriones y Murillo, Marquis of Oroquieto,
an austere soldier, and a stern disciplinarian. He showed himself to be
a man of undaunted courage, and of absolutely incorruptible
honesty.</p>
<p>When he landed in Manila he found that, owing to the weakness of
Admiral Malcampo, his predecessor, the Peninsular Regiment of Artillery
had been in open mutiny, and that the matter had been hushed up. After
taking the oath of office, and attending a Te Deum at the Cathedral, he
mounted his horse, and, attended by his aides-de-camp, rode to the
barracks, and ordered the regiment to parade under arms. He rode down
the ranks, and recognised many soldiers who had served under him in the
Carlist wars.</p>
<p>He then stationed himself in front of the regiment, and delivered a
remarkable and most stirring oration. He said that it grieved him to
the heart to think that Spanish soldiers, sent to the Philippines to
maintain the authority of their king and country, many of whom had with
him faced the awful fusillade of Somorrostro, and had bravely done
their duty, could fall so low as to become callous mutineers, deaf to
the calls of duty, and by their bad conduct tarnish the glory of the
Spanish Army in the eyes of all the world. Such as they deserved no
mercy; their lives were all forfeited. Still he was willing to believe
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>they were not entirely vicious, that repentance
and reform were still possible to the great majority. He would,
therefore, spare the lives of most of them in the hope that they might
once more become worthy soldiers of Spain. But he would decimate them;
every tenth man must die.</p>
<p>He then directed the lieutenant-colonel in command to number off the
regiment by tens from the right.</p>
<p>Let the reader ponder upon the situation. Here was a mutinous
veteran regiment that for months had been the terror of the city, and
had frightened the Governor-General and all the authorities into
condoning its crimes.</p>
<p>In front of it sat upon his horse one withered old man. But that
man&rsquo;s record was such that he seemed to those reckless mutineers
to be transfigured into some awful avenging angel. His modest stature
grew to a gigantic size in their eyes; the whole regiment seemed
hypnotized. They commenced numbering. It was an impressive
scene&mdash;the word ten meant death. The men on the extreme right felt
happy; they were sure to escape. Confidently rang out their voices:
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine&mdash;then a stop.
The doomed wretch standing next would not say the fatal word. Moriones
turned his glance upon the captain of the right company, and that
officer perceived that the crisis of his life had arrived, and that the
next few seconds would make or mar him; one instant&rsquo;s hesitation
would cost him his commission. Drawing and cocking his revolver, he
held it in front of the forehead of the tenth man, and ordered him to
call out <i>ten</i>. Placed thus between the alternative of instant
death or obedience, the unhappy gunner complied, and the numbering of
the whole line was accomplished. The number tens were ordered to step
out of the ranks, were disarmed, placed under arrest, and notified that
they would be shot next morning. As regards the others, all leave was
stopped, and extra drills ordered. Great interest was exerted with
Moriones to pardon the condemned men, and he did commute the death
sentence on most of them, but the ring-leaders were shot the following
morning, others imprisoned, and fifty were sent back to Spain in the
same vessel as Admiral Malcampo, whose pampering of them had ruined
their discipline. So much for the courage of Moriones. It was a
wonderful example of the prestige of lawful authority, but of course
the risk was great.</p>
<p>To him was due the construction of the Manila Waterworks.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>A sum of money had been left a century before by
Don Francisco Carriedo, who had been general of a galleon, to
accumulate until it was sufficient to pay for the waterworks, which
ought to have been begun years before. However, the parties who held
these funds, like certain Commissioners we know of at home, had little
desire to part with the capital, and it was only the determination of
General Moriones that triumphed over their reluctance.</p>
<p>Manila ought to be ever grateful to Moriones for this. He also tried
to get some work out of the Obras Publicas Department, and, in fact, he
did frighten them into exerting themselves for a time, by threatening
to ship the Inspector-General of Public Works back to Spain, unless the
Ayala bridges were completed on a certain day.</p>
<p>But the greatest thing that Moriones did for the Philippines was
when he prevented the sale of the Government tobacco-culture monopoly
to some Paris Jews. Whilst he was staying at the Convent of Guadalupe
he received a letter from C&aacute;novas, at the time Prime Minister of
Spain. It informed him that a project was entertained of selling the
Crown monopoly of the cultivation and manufacture of tobacco in the
Philippines to a Franco-Spanish syndicate, and added, &ldquo;The palace
is very interested,&rdquo; meaning that the King and the Infantas were
in the affair. It announced that a Commission was about to be sent by
the capitalists to enquire into the business, and wound up by
requesting Moriones to report favourably on the affair, for which
service he might ask any reward he liked. The carrying out of this
project meant selling the inhabitants of Cagayan into slavery.</p>
<p>I had this information from a gentleman of unblemished truth and
honour, who was present at the receipt of the letter, and it was
confirmed by two friars of the Augustinian Order under circumstances
that left no doubt upon my mind as to their accuracy.</p>
<p>Although C&aacute;novas was at the time in the height of his power,
and although the King was interested in the matter going through,
Moriones indignantly refused to back up the proposal. He wrote or
cabled to C&aacute;novas not to send out the Commission, for if it came
he would send it back by the same vessel. He reported dead against the
concession, and told the Prime Minister that he was quite prepared to
resign, and return to Spain, to explain his reasons from his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>seat in the Senate. What a contrast this brave
soldier made to the general run of men; how few in any country would
have behaved as he did!</p>
<p>This was not the only benefit Moriones conferred upon the tobacco
cultivators of Cagay&aacute;n, for he did what he could to pay off the
debt owing to them by the Treasury.</p>

<h3 class="main">Primo de Rivera.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The next Governor-General was Don Fernando Primo de
Rivera, Marquis of Estella, and he was the only one with whom I was not
personally acquainted. During the cholera epidemic of 1882, when 30,000
persons died in the city and province of Manila, he showed ability and
firmness in the arrangements he made, and he deserves great credit for
this. But corruption and embezzlement was rampant during his time.
Gambling was tolerated in Manila and it was currently reported that
twenty-five gambling houses were licensed and that each paid $50 per
day, which was supposed to go to the Governor-General. Emissaries from
these houses were stationed near the banks and mercantile offices, and
whenever a collector was seen entering or leaving carrying a bag of
dollars, an endeavour was made to entice him to the gambling table, and
owing to the curious inability of the native to resist temptation,
these overtures were too frequently successful.</p>
<p>The whole city became demoralised, servants and dependants stole
from their employers and sold the articles to receivers for a tenth of
their value in order to try their luck at the gaming table. A sum of
$1250 per day was derived from the gambling-houses and was collected
every evening.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all these abuses, Primo de Rivera maintained good
relations with the natives; he was not unpopular, and no disturbances
occurred during his first government. He owed his appointment to King
Alfonso XII., being granted three years&rsquo; pillage of the
Philippine Islands as a reward for having made the
<i>pronunciamento</i> in favour of that monarch, which greatly
contributed to putting him upon the throne. He and his friends must
have amassed an enormous sum of money, for scarcely a cent was expended
on roads or bridges during his government, the provincial governors
simply pocketed every dollar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Jovellar.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">He was succeeded by Field-Marshal Don Joaquim
Jovellar, during whose time the tribute was abolished and the
C&eacute;dulas Personales tax instituted. Jovellar appeared to me to be
a strictly honourable man, he refused the customary presents from the
Chinese, and bore himself with much dignity. His <i>entourage</i> was,
however, deplorable, and he placed too much confidence in Ruiz
Martinez, the Director of Civil Administration. The result was that
things soon became as bad as in the previous governor&rsquo;s time.
Jovellar was well advanced in years, being nearly seventy. He had many
family troubles, and the climate did not agree with him.</p>
<p>I remember one stifling night, when I was present at
Malaca&ntilde;an at a ball and water f&ecirc;te, given to Prince Oscar,
a son of the King of Sweden. The Governor-General had hardly recovered
from an illness, and had that day received most distressing news about
two of his sons, and his daughter Do&ntilde;a Rosita, who was married
to Colonel Arsenio Linares, was laid up and in danger of losing her
sight.</p>
<p>Yet in that oppressive heat, and buttoned up in the full dress
uniform of a field-marshal, Jovellar went round the rooms and found a
kind word or compliment for every lady present. I ventured to remark
how fatigued he must be, to which he replied, &ldquo;Yes, but make no
mistake, a public man is like a public woman, and must smile on
everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During his time, owing to symptoms of unrest amongst the natives,
the garrison of Manila and Cavite was reinforced by two battalions of
marines.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">He was succeeded by Don Emilio Terrero y Perinat, a
thorough soldier and a great martinet. I found him a kind and courteous
gentleman, and deeply regretted the unfortunate and tragic end that
<span class="corr" id="xd20e2677" title="Source: befel">befell</span>
him after his return to Spain. I saw a good deal of Field-Marshal
Jovellar and of General Terrero, having been Acting British Consul at
the end of Jovellar&rsquo;s and the beginning of Terrero&rsquo;s
Government. I kept up my acquaintance with General Terrero <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>all the
time he was in the islands, and was favoured with frequent invitations
to his table, where I met all the principal officials.</p>
<p>Things went on quietly in his time and there was little to record
except successful expeditions to Jol&oacute; and Mindanao, causing an
extension of Spanish influence in both places.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Weyler.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Terrero was succeeded by Don Valeriano Weyler, Marquis
of T&eacute;n&eacute;rife, the son of a German doctor, born in Majorca,
who brought with him a reputation for cruelties practised on the Cuban
insurgents during the first war.</p>
<p>Weyler was said to have purchased the appointment from the wife of a
great minister too honest to accept bribes himself, and the price was
commonly reported to have been $30,000 paid down and an undertaking to
pay the lady an equal sum every year of his term of office.</p>
<p>Weyler is a small man who does not look like a soldier. He is
clever, but it is more the cleverness of a sharp attorney than of a
general or statesman.</p>
<p>Curiously enough the Segundo Cabo at this time was an absolute
contrast. Don Manuel Giron y Aragon, Marquis of Ahumada, is descended
from the Kings of Aragon, and to that illustrious lineage he unites a
noble presence and a charm of manner that render him instantly popular
with all who have the good fortune to meet him. No more dignified
representative of his country could be found, and I send him my cordial
salutation wherever he is serving.</p>
<p>During Weyler&rsquo;s term another expedition to Mindanao was made
and some advantages secured. Some disturbances occurred which will be
mentioned in another chapter, and secret societies were instituted
amongst the natives. Otherwise the usual bribery and corruption
continued unchecked.</p>
<p>There was a great increase in the smuggling of Mexican dollars from
Hong Kong into Manila, where they were worth 10 per cent. more. The
freight and charges amounted to 2 per cent., leaving 8 per cent.
profit, and according to rumour 4 per cent. was paid to the authorities
to insure against seizure, as the importation was prohibited under
heavy penalties. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>At this time I was Government Surveyor of Shipping, and one day
received an order from the captain of the port to proceed on board the
steamer <i>Espa&ntilde;a</i> with the colonel of carbineers and point
out to him all hollow places in the ship&rsquo;s construction where
anything could be concealed. This I did, but remembering
Talleyrand&rsquo;s injunction, and not liking the duty, showed no zeal,
but contented myself with obeying orders. The carbineers having
searched every part of the ship below, we came on deck where the
captain&rsquo;s cabin was. A corporal entered the cabin and pulled open
one of the large drawers. I only took one glimpse at it and looked
away. It was chock full of small canvas bags, and no doubt the other
drawers and lockers were also full. Yet it did not seem to occur to any
of the searchers that there might be dollars in the bags, and it was no
business of mine. Nothing contraband had been found in the ship, and a
report to that effect was sent in. I sent the colonel an account for my
fee, which was duly paid from the funds of the corps.</p>
<p>Weyler returned to Spain with a large sum of money, a far larger sum
than the whole of his emoluments. He had remitted large sums in bills,
and having fallen out with one of his confederates who had handled some
of the money, this man exhibited the seconds of exchange to certain
parties inimical to Weyler, with the result that the latter was openly
denounced as a thief in capital letters in a leading article of the
<i lang="es">Correspondencia Militar</i> of Madrid. Weyler&rsquo;s
attorneys threatened to prosecute for libel, but the editor defied them
and declared that he held the documents and was prepared to prove his
statement. The matter was allowed to drop. Weyler was thought to have
received large sums of money from the Augustinians and Dominicans for
his armed support against their tenants. It was said that the Chinese
furnished him with a first-rate cook, and provided food for his whole
household gratis, besides making presents of diamonds to his wife. And
for holding back certain laws which would have pressed very hardly upon
them, it was asserted that the Celestials paid him no less than
$80,000. This is the man who afterwards carried out the <i lang=
"es">reconcentrado</i> policy in Cuba at the cost of thousands of
lives, and subsequently returning with a colossal fortune to Spain,
posed as a patriot and as chief of the military party. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Despujols.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To Weyler succeeded a man very different in appearance
and character, Don Emilio Despujols, Conde de Caspe.</p>
<p>Belonging to an ancient and noble family of Catalonia, holding his
honour dear, endowed with a noble presence and possessed of an ample
fortune, he came out to uplift and uphold the great charge committed to
him, and rather to give lustre to his office by expending his own means
than to economise from his pay, as so many colonial governors are
accustomed to do. He established his household upon a splendid scale,
and seconded by his distinguished countess, whose goodness and
munificent charities will ever be remembered, he entertained on a scale
worthy of a viceroy and in a manner never before seen in Manila.</p>
<p>Despujols rendered justice to all. Several Spaniards whose lives
were an open scandal, were by his order put on board ship and sent back
to Spain. Amongst these was one who bore the title of count, but who
lived by gambling.</p>
<p>Another was a doctor who openly plundered the natives. Like a
Mahometan Sultan of the old times, Despujols was accessible to the
poorest who had a tale of injustice and oppression to relate.</p>
<p>The news that a native could obtain justice from a governor-general
flew with incredible rapidity. At last a new era seemed to be opening.
A trifling event aroused the enthusiasm of the people. Despujols and
his countess drove to the Manila races with their postillions dressed
in shirts of J&uacute;si and wearing silver-mounted salacots instead of
their usual livery. I was present on this occasion and was struck with
the unwonted warmth of the governor-general&rsquo;s reception from the
usually phlegmatic natives. Despujols became popular to an extent never
before reached. He could do anything with the natives. Whenever his
splendid equipages appeared in public he received an ovation. Quite a
different spirit now seemed to possess the natives. But not all the
Spaniards viewed this with satisfaction; many whose career of
corruption had been checked, who found their illicit gains decreased,
and the victims of their extortion beginning to resist them, bitterly
criticised the new governor-general. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>The religious orders finding Despujols incorruptible and indisposed
to place military forces at the disposal of the Augustinians and
Dominicans to coerce or evict refractory tenants, then took action.
Their procurators in Madrid made a combined attack on Despujols, both
in the reptile press and by representations to the ministry. They
succeeded, and Despujols was dismissed from office by cable. Rumour has
it that the Orders paid $100,000 for Despujols&rsquo;s recall. For my
own part I think this very likely, and few who know Madrid will suppose
that this decree could be obtained by any other means.</p>
<p>He laboured under a disadvantage, for he did not pay for his
appointment as some others did. If he had been paying $30,000 a year to
the wife of a powerful minister, he would not have been easily
recalled. Or if, like another governor-general, he had been in debt up
to the eyes to influential creditors, these would have kept him in
power till he had amassed enough to pay them off.</p>
<p>I am of opinion that had Despujols been retained in Manila, and had
he been given time to reform and purify the administration, the chain
of events which has now torn the Philippines for ever from the grasp of
Spain would never have been welded. Whoever received the priests&rsquo;
money, whoever they were who divided that Judas-bribe, they deserve to
be held in perpetual execration by their fellow-countrymen, and to have
their names handed down to everlasting infamy.</p>
<p>Despujols left Manila under a manifestation of respect and devotion
from the foreign residents, from the best Spaniards and from every
class of the natives of the Philippines, that might well go far to
console him for his unmerited dismissal. He must have bitterly felt the
injustice with which he was treated, but still he left carrying with
him a clear conscience and a harvest of love and admiration that no
previous governor-general had ever inspired.</p>
<p>For if Moriones manifested courage, energy and incorruptible honesty
under what would have been an irresistible temptation to many another
man, that rude soldier was far from possessing those personal gifts,
the fine presence and the sympathetic address of Despujols, and
inspired fear rather than affection.</p>
<p>Yet both were worthy representatives of their country; both were men
any land might be proud to send forth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>Those two noble names are
sufficient to redeem the Spanish Government of the Philippines from the
accusation of being entirely corrupt, too frequently made against it.
They deserve an abler pen than mine to extol their merits and to exalt
them as they deserve above the swarm of pilferers, and sham patriots,
who preceded and succeeded them. To use an Eastern image, they may be
compared to two noble trees towering above the rank vegetation of some
poisonous swamp. For the honour of Spain and of human nature in
general, I have always felt grateful that I could say that amongst the
governors-general of the Philippines whom I had known there were at
least two entitled to the respect of every honest man. <span class=

<p class="first">The foulest blot upon the Spanish Administration in
all her former colonies was undoubtedly the thorough venality of her
infamous Courts of Justice. Unfortunately, amongst the heterogeneous
population of the Philippines, a low standard of morality prevails and
has prevailed from the earliest times. The natives at the time of the
conquest were partly civilised, so far as building houses and
cultivating their lands by slave labour is concerned. But
notwithstanding the assertions of the Filipinos, the late Dr. Rizal and
others, a study of the ancient authors demonstrates that they were sunk
in ignorance and superstition, and that their customs were those of
semi-savages. When they came under the rule of the Spaniards, they
might have made great advances if the administration of the laws had
been confided to persons of honour capable of interpreting that wise
code, the &ldquo;Laws of the Indies,&rdquo; in the noble and Christian
spirit which had inspired their makers<span class="corr" id="xd20e2754"

<p>But what class of man was it that the Spaniards appointed to this
office?</p>
<p>Thomas de Comyn, p. 134, says: &ldquo;It is quite common to see a
barber or footman of a governor, a sailor or a deserter, transformed
into an Alcalde-Mayor, Sub-delegate, and War Captain of a populous
province, without other counsel than his own rude intelligence
(understanding) nor other guide than his passions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could be expected from such men as these, living in such an
atmosphere? And if some solitary alcalde might cherish in his heart
some spark of honour, some lingering love of justice, there were two
elements in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>the country to extinguish that spark, to smother
that feeling.</p>
<p>Woe betide the alcalde who would decide a case, whatever its merits,
adversely to any one of the religious orders. I personally knew an
alcalde who (at a great price) had obtained the government of the
province of Batangas, from whence his immediate predecessor, also
well-known to me, had retired with a large fortune, but leaving
everybody contented so far as could be seen. He had kept on good terms
with the priests. His successor unfortunately forgot this cardinal rule
and allowed himself to be identified with some anti-clerical
Spaniards.</p>
<p>Every kind of trouble fell upon that man, and finally he was
recalled to Manila and received a severe reprimand from General Primo
de Rivera, who was said to have received $12,000 for turning him
out.</p>
<p>He was removed from wealthy Batangas and sent to the fever-stricken
capital of Tayabas, a wretchedly poor Government, affording few
opportunities for peculation. He escaped with his life, but his wife, a
very charming Spanish lady, succumbed to the malaria. Similar instances
of the results of being, or being thought to be, an anti-clerical, will
occur to old residents in the Philippines. The arm of the Church was
long and its hand was a heavy one.</p>
<p>The second influence I referred to is the presence of the heathen
Chinee in the islands. To a Chinaman the idea that a judge should take
bribes seems as natural a thing as that a duck should take to the
water. And yet the Chinaman will not, unless he knows he is on the
right track, brutally push his bribe under the judge&rsquo;s nose.
Either he or one of his countrymen will from the judge&rsquo;s arrival
have rendered him good service. Does the judge want a gardener or cook?
Ah-sin soon provides an excellent one who never asks for his wages.
Have some visitors arrived at the <span class="corr" id="xd20e2773"
title="Source: Alcadia">Alcaldia</span> Ah-sin sends in a dozen
chickens, a turkey, and the best fruits. Is it the judge&rsquo;s
name-day? The wily Celestial presents a few cases of wine and boxes of
fine cigars. Is the roof of the Alcaldia leaking&mdash;a couple of
Chinese carpenters will set it right without sending a bill for it.
Then, having prepared the way, should Ah-sin be summoned before the
alcalde, he may confidently hope that his patron will not hurriedly
give judgment against him, and that he will probably get a full
opportunity to present substantial reasons why the suit should be
decided in his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>favour. In fact, the practice of the
alcalde&rsquo;s courts was only a shade better than that of the Chinese
Yamens, where the different cases are put up to auction amongst the
magistrates and knocked down to the highest bidders, who then proceed
on a course of extortion, by arrest and by the torture of witnesses, to
make all they can out of them.</p>
<p>In an alcalde&rsquo;s court, there would be several mestizo or
native writers or auxiliaries. Some of them were what is called
<i>merit&oacute;rios</i>, that is, unpaid volunteers. Of course, they
expect to receive gratuities from the suitors and would take care to
mislay their documents if they were neglected. Sometimes the alcalde
was so lazy that he left the whole matter in the hands of his
subordinates and signed whatever they laid before him. I have been a
witness of this, and have even remonstrated with a judge for so doing.
He, however, said he had the greatest confidence in his subordinates
and that they dare not deceive him.</p>
<p>Bad as the alcalde&rsquo;s courts were, I think that the culminating
point of corruption was the Audiencia of Manila. Escribano, abogado,
j&uacute;ez, auditor, fisc&aacute;l, vied with each other in showing
that to them, honour and dignity were mere empty words. They set the
vilest examples to the mestizos and natives, and, unfortunately, these
have been only too apt pupils, and having little to lose, were often
ready to go one better than the Spaniards, who after all had to keep up
appearances. I cannot adequately express the loathing I feel for all
this tribe. I look upon a highwayman as a gentleman compared to them,
for he does risk his life, and you may get a shot at him, but these
wretches ruin you in perfect safety.</p>
<p>They dress their wives, they nourish their children, upon the reward
of roguery, the price of perjury, the fruits of forgery, the wages of
some wicked judgment.</p>
<p>What can be expected of the spawn of these reptiles, what but by the
process of evolution to be more envenomed than their progenitors? Is
there not amongst all the multitudinous Philippines some desert island
where the people trained in the Spanish courts and all their breed
could be deported, where they might set up a court, and bring actions
against each other and cheat and lie and forge till they die?</p>
<p>What a Godsend for the Philippines were this possible, if besides
getting rid of the Spanish judges, they could now <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>get rid
of their aiders and abettors, their apt pupils and would-be
successors.</p>
<p>Bribery is a fine art, and there were those in Manila who were well
versed in its intricacies. We heard one day of a decree by a judge
against the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Club gossip
asserted that the judge who issued the decree had lost some hundreds of
dollars at the gambling table of the Casino the night before, and that
the artistic corrupter had called on him in the morning with the means
to pay the debt of honour and to try his luck again. The judge was
known not to have the means of paying, yet he paid and simultaneously
issued his decree. Old Manila hands drew their inference.</p>
<p>The record of these courts from the earliest times is one
long-continued infamy. Thank God that is over and a new chapter has
begun. I rejoice exceedingly that their sins have at last overtaken
them, and I recognise that, though</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The mills of God grind slowly,</p>
<p class="line">Yet they grind exceeding small.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Owing to the demoralisation of the mestizo and native
lawyers by these vile examples, it will be very difficult to break the
traditions of venality and to find men worthy to occupy the bench.</p>
<p>These courts were not only corrupt, but they were inept. At a time
when brigandage prevailed and many notorious criminals were apprehended
almost red-handed, convictions could not be got, and the bandits were
liberated on various pretexts.</p>
<p>So great was the scandal that Moriones issued a decree that all
persons accused of gang-robbery should be tried by a military tribunal.
And he appointed a permanent court-martial for this purpose, to the
great disgust of all the lawyer element. These courts were abolished
some years later after his return to Spain; then the Guardia Civil made
their own arrangements, and the mortality amongst bandits was
excessive. When some well-known robber was by any chance taken alive,
he always, so they said, tried to escape by running away from his
captors, and this obliged them to fire upon him. They never missed on
these occasions, and it was thought that the range never exceeded ten
paces and was often less.</p>
<p>However necessary this military action may be, it is, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>undoubtedly liable to abuse, and the power of life
and death is a great one to put in the hands of a junior officer or
non-commissioned officer of police. The Guardia Civil, an armed force
with Spanish officers and native soldiers, was organised in 1867, and I
must say that I looked upon it as an excellent institution, the terror
of evil-doers and a protection to all law-abiding people. My native
friends, however, are of a different opinion. They accuse the Guardia
Civil, both Spaniards and natives, of behaving in an arbitrary and
cruel manner, and with practising extortion upon defenceless natives.
They are accused of torturing witnesses to extort evidence, and this
charge was no doubt true in many cases<span class="corr" id="xd20e2814"
title="Source: ,">.</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, the bandits or tulisanes were exterminated by
this corps of picked men, and security to life and property was
assured. At the formation of this corps the officers and men were very
carefully selected. The Governor-General himself examined the records
of every officer, and only Spanish gentlemen of the highest character
were appointed. Similarly the soldiers were natives who had served
their time in the army without having a crime noted against them. But
in later years this precaution was relaxed, and colonels of regiments
were allowed to dump their rubbish into this corps.</p>
<p>I knew of a case where a Filipino with Irish blood in him was posted
as a lieutenant to this corps and behaved most abominably. I am glad to
say, however, that he was sent out of the islands. This was only
another instance of the fact that whatever the natives have to complain
of the Spaniards, the mestizos, and their own rich people, treat them
and have always treated them far worse.</p>
<p>Both officers and men were well paid and were dressed in a very
smart and neat uniform, well suited to the climate, which they kept
spick and span whatever service they were on. They were armed with
Remington rifles and bayonets, and in addition carried a heavy chopping
knife. They were posted at all the chief towns of Luzon and in some of
the Visayas Islands. The greatest crime a native could commit was to
kill a Guardia Civil, and such a matter never came before a Civil
Court. If the slayer by any chance was not killed on the spot, he would
probably be shot at sight. If apprehended, he would be tried by a
court-martial composed of officers of the Guardia Civil, and, needless
to say, there would be no monkeying with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>verdict
nor with the sentence, which would be promptly carried out.</p>
<p>Even to resist the Guardia Civil was so great a crime that the
sentence of a court-martial in such a case was penal servitude for life
(Cad&eacute;na Perp&eacute;tua).</p>
<p>How surprised a London rough would be at this severity after being
accustomed to expiate the most brutal assaults upon the police by a
fine of a few shillings.</p>
<p>To sum up the Guardia Civil, I may say that their practice was
comprised in five memorable words, addressed to a similar corps by Mr.
A. J. Balfour in his energetic days, a most sensible order, that he may
well be proud of: &ldquo;Do not hesitate to shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amongst other duties of the Guardia Civil in bygone years was the
making of periodical expeditions against the <i>remontados</i> and the
hill tribes, officially designated Talas, or cuttings down.</p>
<p>At certain favourable seasons of the year, especially before harvest
time, the Guardias, accompanied by some Cuadrilleros, and on important
occasions by a company of native infantry, marched up into the more
accessible hills.</p>
<p>The hill-men obstructed the tracks in the most difficult places by
cutting down trees and making abattis.</p>
<p>They also placed sharp bamboo spikes carefully concealed in the
earth or mud of the footpaths, and these, if trodden on, inflicted most
dangerous wounds that were apt to gangrene. Sometimes if they had much
at stake, the hill-men or outlaws would venture an ambuscade, and hurl
their javelins or send a flight of arrows amongst their enemies.</p>
<p>But even the boldest races rarely came to close quarters, for their
weapons were no match against rifles and bayonets. So, led by their
spies, the Spanish forces laboured upwards, and on arriving at the
hamlets of the mountaineers or outlaws they burnt down the rude huts,
reaped the crops, taking away what they could and burning the
remainder.</p>
<p>They cut down every fruit tree and took special care to destroy
every tobacco plant. They then retired, leaving a scene of devastation
behind them.</p>
<p>If any of the hill-men fell into their hands their fate depended
upon whether there were any murders to avenge or upon the humanity of
the officer in command. This wanton destruction was committed chiefly
in the interests of the tobacco monopoly, but also in order to force
the hillmen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>to come down and reside in the towns. It had,
however, an entirely contrary effect, for the savages either retired
into more inaccessible regions, or perhaps abandoned cultivation and
lived a roving, marauding life like the Itetapanes and
Catubanganes.</p>
<p>Since the abolition of the tobacco monopoly the Talas have been less
frequent, and there was a feeling amongst the authorities that these
cruel and demoralising expeditions should be discontinued, unless in
cases where the hill-men had given great provocation.</p>
<p>The Spaniards are, of course, not the only nation to make these
forays. In the last campaign against the Afridis the British troops
were employed, under orders, to blow up the houses, break the
mill-stones, and cut down the trees of the enemy, not even sparing the
shade trees round a mosque. It was probably the only way to inflict
punishment on the Afridis.</p>
<p>The worst feature is that in all such cases a crop of bitter hatred
is sown in the hearts of the sufferers, which matures later on, and
which is handed down from one generation to another. <span class=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The penal code of the Philippines, which came into
force in 1884, declares it impossible to consider as an aggravation of
an offence the circumstance of colour or race in the offender, for the
criminal is to be punished for his crime and not for the condition of
inferiority to which nature has condemned him.</p>
<p>It goes on to say that on the other hand his condition should not be
allowed to attenuate the sentence, for that would constitute an odious
privilege, an unbearable inequality.</p>
<p>It therefore proudly proclaims the equality of all races before the
law. These are noble words; we shall see how they work out in
practice.</p>
<p>The case of Juan de la Cruz shows us that a criminal investigation
can drag on for twelve years without coming on for trial when the
victims are natives and of lowly station. I could cite cases where the
victims were British subjects, and the murderers were never punished,
and another case where a Frenchman was the victim. The murderer in this
case was to have been pardoned by the Governor-General, but the French
consul threatened to haul down his flag and leave the islands unless
the assassin was executed; and he was executed, the consul attending to
see the sentence carried out</p>
<p>The British Foreign Office does not encourage its agents to such
energetic acts. To obtain the good graces of the Foreign Office a
consul should be devoid of talent or originality. Mediocrity is the
condition sought for. It is never advisable for one of Her Britannic
Majesty&rsquo;s consuls <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href=
"#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>to be active in protecting Her
Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s subjects. What he must aim at if he wishes
for consideration and promotion is to give the Foreign Office no
trouble. The ideal consul would be he who is only heard of once a
quarter, when he certifies that he is alive, and asks that his salary
may be paid.</p>
<p>I will relate a murder that made an impression on me at the time,
where the victim was a Spaniard. In June of 1881, I was at Santa Cruz
in the Laguna Province for several days, making experiments with some
patent centrifugals, steaming and drying the fine Laguna sugar. Quite
close to the <i>camarin</i>, where the machines were at work, lived an
elderly Spaniard who was a government employ&eacute; in some
subordinate position. I think he was the Subdelegado de Hacienda, or
sub-provincial treasurer. I had once or twice called upon the old
gentleman, whose appearance and manners were above his official rank,
and had been politely received by him. On completing my experiments, I
called to take leave of him, and was sorry to find him suffering from
fever, and very weak.</p>
<p>I returned to Manila, and next day was horrified to read in a
newspaper that he had been murdered in the night by his two servants.
This atrocious crime, committed on a helpless and infirm old man, with
every circumstance of premeditation and barbarity, and with the object
of robbery, roused the indignation of every European. The culprits were
soon apprehended, and such expedition was used by the Promotor Fiscal
and the court, that within a week from the perpetration of the murder
the two servants were garrotted on a scaffold erected near the scene of
their barbarous crime.</p>
<p>Such is the rapidity with which the Philippine courts could act when
a Spaniard was the victim and when public opinion was deeply stirred by
some shocking tragedy.</p>

<h3 class="main">The case of Juan de la Cruz.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following narrative of events, which occurred in
1886, will give the reader a good idea of the furious passions that may
lurk under the inscrutable features of the Philippine Malay, and will
also serve to illustrate the procedure of the Spanish criminal courts
when the victims are natives and when nothing can be made out of the
case. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>Four of the five actors or victims in the tragedy
were well known to me, and I learned all the particulars at first hand
and at the time, from those who took steps to deliver over the culprit
to justice.</p>
<p>The decked steam launch <i>Laguimanoc</i> belonged to Gustav Brown,
a ship carpenter, and was hired by the Varadero, or Slipway Company of
Ca&ntilde;acao, near Cavite, to keep up communication with Manila,
whilst the slip was being constructed.</p>
<p>I was consulting engineer to the company, and Mr. J. L. Houston was
the resident engineer in charge of the work. Both of us made frequent
voyages in this launch between Ca&ntilde;acao and Manila. The crew
consisted of a patron (coxswain) named Juan de la Cruz, an
engine-driver, a stoker, and a boy, all Tagals.</p>
<p>Juan de la Cruz was an elderly man with grey hair, and in figure
thin and wiry. He was a good man at his duty, one of the silent Indians
whom I have always found to be the best. A thorough sailor, he had
served under many a flag, and sailed o&rsquo;er many a sea, both in
tropic and in northern climes.</p>
<p>The engine-driver and the stoker were brothers, strong and
well-built young fellows, and smart at their work. The boy was an
active lad, quite pleased to be employed on a steam-boat.</p>
<p>One day, the stoker, going through the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, saw
a piece of square steel, which had been cut off a long bar, lying on
the floor, and it struck him that it would be better than a hammer for
breaking coal. So he annexed it without leave, and got one end drawn
out and rounded so that he could easily hold it. This made a very
efficient coal-breaker, the sharp edges divided the lumps with great
ease. It was about eighteen inches long, and one and three-quarter
inches square. The patron was married, and his wife lived in Manila,
but, sailor-like, he had provided himself with a sweetheart, at the
other end of his run, where he spent more time than in the Pasig, and
had become intimate with a damsel of San Roque, a village between the
Varadero and Cavite. Things went on apparently all right for some time;
the launch making almost daily trips between Ca&ntilde;acao and Manila,
and the elderly patron alternating between the conjugal domicile and
the dwelling of his mistress. She was young, and, as native girls go, a
pretty woman. Come of a strange and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34"
href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>unknown mixture of races, and
bred up amongst a community noted for its profligacy, she knew how to
make the best use of her charms and was well fitted to captivate the
weather-beaten seaman.</p>
<p>He, if not desirable in himself, held a well paid post, and was able
to place her above want.</p>
<p>Already fifty years old, he was as susceptible as a youth and far
more in earnest. Day by day, as he basked in her smiles, his
infatuation increased till he became violently enamoured of his
charmer.</p>
<p>What could be more natural than that the crew of the launch should
become acquainted with the patron&rsquo;s mistress? Soon the
engine-driver and the stoker were her constant visitors. The damsel had
a kind word and a smile for both, and doubtless contrasted their
vigorous youth and shapely forms with the shrunken figure of her
elderly protector, and their lively conversation with his glum
silence.</p>
<p>In the end, no doubt, the damsel refused them nothing.</p>
<p>Trouble was now brewing. The grim sailor was not the man to let
himself be wronged with impunity. All the elements of a tragedy were
present. Things no longer went smoothly on board the <i>Laguimanoc</i>,
and her voyages lost their regularity. Something was perpetually going
wrong with the engines, pieces or fittings disappeared unaccountably,
usually pieces of copper or brass. The engine-driver was blamed, but he
succeeded in averting his impending discharge. Could he have foreseen
the consequences of remaining, he would have promptly discharged
himself.</p>
<p>On board the launch mutual distrust prevailed. The engine-driver
must have known that it was the patron who had thrown overboard the
fittings in his absence, hoping to get him discharged, but he held his
peace.</p>
<p>The silent figure at the tiller made no sign; no trace of emotion
could be seen on the Sphinx-like face, no reproaches passed his lips,
not the slightest manifestation of resentment. But underneath that
imperturbable calm there existed the steadfast determination to have a
full and bloody revenge on all who had offended him. The
<i>Laguimanoc</i> made a voyage to Manila one Saturday to take up the
resident engineer who often spent his Sundays there, the launch
remaining in the river. On Monday morning when he came down to the
launch he found that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"
name="pb35">35</a>]</span>the safety valve was missing from its seat,
and was delayed till another could be procured.</p>
<p>No explanations of the loss of this piece could be got, and the
<i>Laguimanoc</i> proceeded with the resident engineer to
Ca&ntilde;acao and made fast to the jetty.</p>
<p>A crisis was now reached. The abstraction of the safety-valve could
not be overlooked, and some one would have to go. An inquiry was to be
made, but on Tuesday morning the patron walked up the jetty, and
reported to Mr. Gustav Brown, who was the foreman of the works, that
the engine-driver and stoker were absent. He stated that they had gone
ashore in the night, and had not returned. Nothing could be learned
about them; nobody had seen them; their kits were still on board. As
the day wore on they did not come nor send any message; so a report of
their disappearance was sent to the judge at Cavite.</p>
<p>An engine-fitter from the works was sent on board to take charge of
the engine, and another stoker was engaged; the launch resuming her
running. The work of the Varadero proceeded as usual; divers were
preparing the foundations to receive the immense gridiron which was
shortly to be launched and sunk in place. It was a busy scene of
organised labour under a skilful resident engineer; every difficulty
foreseen and provided for, materials delivered in good time,
notwithstanding obstructions; not an unnecessary auger-hole bored, not
a stroke of an adze thrown away.</p>
<p>From the Sleepy Hollow of the naval arsenal opposite jealous eyes
watched the work proceed. Every art of vexation and obstruction that
bitter envy could devise had for years been employed to prevent the
building of this slip, and onerous and unfair conditions had been
inserted in the concession. But Anglo-American persistence and industry
had succeeded so far, and in the hands of Messrs. Peel, Hubbell &amp;
Co. and their advisers, the work was now well advanced.</p>
<p>The obsolete corvette <i>Do&ntilde;a Maria Molina</i> was moored off
the coaling-wharf adjoining the Varadero, and when one of her boats was
going on shore the sailors noticed two dead bodies floating in the
water, and reported this to the officer of the watch, who ordered them
to tow the bodies to the shore towards Punta Sangley, and drag them up
on the sand above high-water mark. The bodies were lashed together with
a piece of new rope having a blue strand in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>the
centre, and had a good-sized piece of white granite attached as a
sinker. On looking at the lashings no one could doubt that the work had
been done by an able seaman. The bodies presented ghastly wounds, both
had fractures of the skull, and gaping cuts on the throat and abdomen;
they had also been gnawed by fishes. The swelling of the bodies had
sufficed to bring them to the surface, stone and all.</p>
<p>The news of the finding of the corpses did not immediately reach the
Varadero, and they were conveyed to Cavite, and buried just as they
were found, tied together with the ropes and stone, without being
identified. It seemed nobody&rsquo;s business to trouble about them,
notwithstanding the evident fact that they had been murdered. The
Manila newspapers did not mention the circumstance.</p>
<p>But at this time other events happened. The patron of the launch
disappeared without taking his kit with him. Then the boy disappeared,
and I may as well at once say that, from that time to this, that boy
has never been heard of by the Varadero Company, who were his
employers. Next, that gay and lascivious damsel of San Roque, whose
unbridled sensuality had wrought the trouble, also disappeared as
mysteriously as the others.</p>
<p>Dr. Juan Perez, of Cavite, was the medical attendant to the staff of
the Varadero, and used to call there every afternoon. On hearing from
him about the discovery of the bodies, the resident engineer at once
thought of his missing men, and the flight of the patron confirmed his
suspicions. A minute examination of the launch was made, and revealed
some stains of blood which had not been entirely removed by the usual
washing down. Several small cuts such as might be made with the point
of a <i>bolo</i> were found in the flat skylight of the cabin, and a
deeper cut on the bulwark rail, starboard side forward, opposite the
skylight. A working rope was missing from the launch. It had only
recently been supplied to it, and had been cut off a whole coil
purchased a few weeks before from a sailing-vessel, for the use of the
Varadero. That rope had a blue strand in the centre. Gustav Brown put
on a diving-dress, and went down at the head of the northern jetty,
where the launch used to lie, and carefully examined the bottom.
Presently his eye rested on an object that he recognised. It was the
square steel coal-breaker used by the stoker, and he brought it up.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new coxswain had been found for the launch, and as the
old patron had left his vessel illegally, there was ground for his
arrest on that score, so orders were given to the new patron and to the
engine-driver to give him into custody if he came to claim his kit.
Next time the launch arrived in Manila, sure enough the old patron
appeared to fetch his belongings, and was taken to the calaboose of the
captain of the port. The resident engineer called on that official,
and, as a result of their conversation, the prisoner was put on board
the launch to be conveyed to Cavite.</p>
<p>With all the stoicism of the Malay, he sat quite still and silent;
his impassive features betrayed no sign of anxiety or remorse.</p>
<p>But if the principal actor in this bloody tragedy could thus compose
his mind, it was not so with others who knew more or less what had
happened, but whose dread and hatred of the law and its myrmidons had
kept their tongues quiet.</p>
<p>When the launch approached the Varadero near enough for the prisoner
to be recognised, an unusual commotion occurred amongst the swarm of
native workmen. A mysterious magnetism, an inexplicable vibration,
pervaded the crowd. Unfelt by the senses, it acted on the mind, and
seemed simultaneously to convey to each individual an identical
idea.</p>
<p>The patron was a prisoner, therefore his crime was known; no good
could be done by keeping silent. Before this nobody knew anything about
the disappearance of the two men. Now it leaked out, but only in
confidence to Gustav Brown, whom they trusted. The native divers had
seen the bodies when at their work on the foundations, and had moved
them farther off out of their way. Men working at the jetties had seen
them when they floated, but had looked in another direction. In fact,
the corpses had been recognised, and the crime was known to scores of
native and Chinese workmen, but no word or hint ever reached the
foreman or the engineer till the culprit was arrested.</p>
<p>Now there were sufficient details to reconstitute the tragic
scene.</p>
<p>The amour of the brothers with the San Roque girl was known, and
also the well-founded jealousy of the patron, who at first endeavoured
to obtain the engine-driver&rsquo;s discharge by the means already
mentioned. This not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38"
name="pb38">38</a>]</span>succeeding, he determined to kill both of
them, and without showing a sign of the deadly hatred that possessed
him, calmly awaited his opportunity.</p>
<p>On the Monday night, 7th June, after the incident of the
safety-valve, the launch was moored alongside the Varadero jetty, and
the two brothers lay fast asleep on the flat top of the cabin skylight,
each wrapped in his blanket.</p>
<p>A native sleeps hard, and is not easily awakened, nor when aroused
does he quickly regain his faculties. It is an important point in the
Malay code of manners never to awaken any person suddenly, for it is
believed that, during sleep, the soul is absent from the body,
wandering around, and must be given time to return, otherwise serious,
even fatal consequences, may ensue. The awakened person may become an
idiot, or some great harm may happen to the unmannerly one who awakened
him. Many natives have as great a fear of the wandering soul of a
sleeping person as of an evil spirit or ghost. The soul is said to
return to the body in the form of a small black ball, which enters the
mouth.</p>
<p>Moreover, one of the greatest, in fact, the most terrible, curse
that can be uttered by many tribes, is, &ldquo;May you die
sleeping,&rdquo; for it means death to body and soul. That, however,
was the fate reserved for the brothers. Towards midnight, when the
cooking-fires in the coolie quarters had burnt down, and the chatter of
the Chinese had subsided, when the last lights in the Europeans&rsquo;
houses had been extinguished, and not a sound broke the stillness of
the night, the patron addressed himself to the performance of his
bloody task. Slipping his sharpened <i>bolo</i> through his belt, he
descended into the engine-room, and, seizing the coal-breaker, crept
forward to where the doomed men slumbered, perhaps dreaming of the
charms of that dark damsel, the enjoyment of whose embraces was to cost
them so dear. Meanwhile, their fate approached; their time was
come.</p>
<p>The patron was past his prime; privations at sea and dissipation on
shore had sapped his strength. But bitter hatred nerving his arm, with
lightning rapidity and terrific force he discharged a blow on each
sleeper&rsquo;s unprotected head. The sharp edge of the steel bar
crashed deep into their skulls, driving in the splintered bone upon the
brain. One agonised shudder from each, then all was still. A European
murderer might have been satisfied with this. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>Not so a
Tagal. A ceremony still remained to be accomplished. Their blood must
flow; they must suffer mutilation. Seizing his <i>bolo</i>, the
assassin now vented his rage in cutting and thrusting at the bodies.
The heavy and keen-edged blade fell repeatedly, cutting great gashes on
the throats and bellies of the victims, whilst streams of gore ran down
the waterways, and trickled out at the scuppers, staining the white
sides of the launch with crimson streaks.</p>
<p>His blood-thirst assuaged, his vengeance partly accomplished, and
his spirit comforted by his desperate deed, the murderer probably
paused for a time, and began to consider how he could conceal his
crime. No sign of movement anywhere. Apparently the dull sounds of the
blows had fallen on no mortal ear. Presently, taking up one of his
working ropes, he mounted the jetty, and walked to the shore, where
there lay a pile of stone ballast. It was white granite, discharged
from a sailing-ship that had come from Hong Kong in ballast, and it had
been purchased for the Varadero. Selecting a suitable piece, he carried
it to the end of the jetty, and lowered it by the rope into the launch.
Then, descending, he firmly lashed the two bodies together, and
fastened the stone to them. Then he drew the bodies to the side,
preparatory to launching them overboard. Now an incident occurred. It
is thought that one of the two men was not quite dead, notwithstanding
his dreadful wounds, and that recovering consciousness, and perceiving
what awaited him, seized the rail in his death-grasp, and resisted the
attempt to throw him over.</p>
<p>The patron must once again have had recourse to his murderous
<i>bolo</i>, bringing it down on the clenched hand, for a deep cut was
found on the rail with blood driven into the pores of the wood by that
savage blow. The tendons severed, the hand unclasped, and next moment
the bodies slid over the rail and down underneath the keel of the
launch in some four fathoms of water. Throwing the steel coal-breaker
after them, the patron&rsquo;s next task was to wash away the traces of
his crime, and this he did fairly well so that nothing was noticed,
till, suspicion being aroused, a careful scrutiny was made, with the
result already mentioned. It is not known whether the boy knew anything
of the tragedy performed so near him, for he was never questioned,
having apparently disappeared off the face of the earth as soon as the
bodies were found. What the patron did afterwards can only be
conjectured. Guilty of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40"
name="pb40">40</a>]</span>two atrocious murders, and of savage
mutilation of the slain, could he have composed himself to a quiet and
dreamless slumber? Or was his imagination fired to further revenge by
dream-pictures of his once-loved mistress in the arms of her youthful
lovers? All that is known is that he presented himself to the foreman
early on the Tuesday morning, and reported the absence of the two men
without showing on his dark visage the slightest sign of trouble or
emotion.</p>
<p>We left the patron a prisoner on the launch. Now it became necessary
to give him in charge to the judicial authorities, for it was getting
late in the afternoon. They did not show any undue eagerness to receive
him. The judge first applied to explained that he was only acting
temporarily, that the judge had departed, having been transferred to
another place, and that the new judge had not yet arrived, therefore he
much regretted he could not take up the case. An appeal was then made
to the Gobernador-Politico-Militar, who most courteously explained that
a civil court was established in the province with full jurisdiction,
both criminal and civil, so that he could not interfere. It was now
nearly sunset, and the prisoner had been on the launch all day. The
resident engineer then called on the Commandante of
Ca&ntilde;acao&mdash;a naval officer who had a few marines at his
disposal&mdash;and obtained as a personal favour that the prisoner
should be temporarily secured in the guard-room. The next day the
resident engineer proceeded to Cavite, and, accompanied by Dr. Juan
Perez, visited the principal authorities, and eventually succeeded in
getting the prisoner lodged in jail, and a charge of murder entered
against him. The bodies of the victims were never exhumed for
examination. The resident engineer made a declaration, which was taken
down in writing, and on one of his busiest days he was peremptorily
summoned to appear before the judge, and solemnly ratify his
testimony.</p>
<p>About three days after Juan de la Cruz was lodged in Cavite jail,
the dead body of the San Roque damsel, gashed by savage blows of the
fatal <i>bolo</i>, was left by the ebb on the sands of
Para&ntilde;aque, a village just across the little Bay of Bacoor
opposite to San Roque. She had paid with her life for her frailty as
many another woman has done in every clime. From the appearance of the
body it was thought it had been several days in the water. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>No legal evidence was forthcoming to fix the crime on any one,
although few of those who knew the story harboured a doubt that the
assassin of the two brothers was the murderer of the girl also.</p>
<p>Juan de la Cruz remained in prison, and from time to time, but with
increasing intervals, the resident engineer, the foreman and others
were cited by the judge, interrogated, then cited again to ratify their
declarations.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">espediente</i>, a pile of stamped paper, grew
thicker and thicker, but the trial seemed no nearer. Month after month
rolled on, the Varadero was finished, ships were drawn up, repaired and
launched, Juan continued in prison.</p>
<p>The resident engineer departed to other climes, and was soon
expending his energy in building the great harbour at La Guayra. I was
the means of obtaining an order for six gun-boats for the Varadero
Company. They were built, launched, tried and delivered, and steamed
away to overawe the piratical Moros. Still Juan continued in prison.
Judges came and judges went, but the trial came no nearer. Year after
year a judge of the Audiencia came in state to inspect the prisoners,
and year after year Juan was set down as awaiting his trial.</p>
<p>In December, 1892, I left the Philippines for Cuba and Juan de la
Cruz was still in Cavite jail.</p>
<p>Dr. Juan Perez, the surgeon who had examined the corpses, died,
having wrongly diagnosed his own case, and Dr. Hugo Perez, a half
caste, was appointed in his stead. Gustav Brown, the foreman, wearied
of the monotony of ship repairing, became possessed by a longing to
resume his nomadic life amongst the palm-clad islands of the Pacific.
He purchased a schooner and embarked with his wife and family. First
running down to Singapore to take in trade-goods for bartering with the
natives, he sailed away for the Carolines where his wife&rsquo;s home
lay. He never reached them; for, soon after leaving Singapore, he came
to a bloody end at the hands of his Chinese crew, who killed and
decapitated him.</p>
<p>The insurrection broke out in Cavite Province, Colonel
Mattone&rsquo;s column was defeated by the insurgents with great
slaughter. Dr. Hugo Perez, the successor of Dr. Juan Perez, was
suspected of sympathising with the rebels, and, needless to say,
<i>he</i> soon came to a bloody end. <i>He</i> did not have to wait
long for his trial. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>In 1896, Mr. George Gilchrist, the engineer at the Varadero, who was
not in the Philippines when the murders were committed, was cited by
the judge, and asked if he could <i>identify the prisoner ten years
after his arrest</i>! Two years more passed, and in April, 1898, Mr.
Gilchrist returned to Scotland for a well-earned holiday. When he left
Ca&ntilde;acao, Juan de la Cruz was still in prison awaiting his
trial.</p>
<p>He may have escaped when the rebels occupied Cavite after Admiral
Dewey&rsquo;s victory over the Spanish Squadron in the Bay of
Bacoor.</p>
<p>For the murderer no pity need be felt, he certainly had nothing to
gain and all to lose by a trial. A double murder, premeditated,
accompanied by acts of great barbarity, and committed at night,
constitutes by the Penal Code a capital offence with three aggravating
circumstances which would forbid all hope of clemency.</p>
<p>But what can be thought of courts so remiss in their duty? How many
innocent prisoners have waited years for their trial? How many have
died in prison?</p>

<h3 class="main">Piratical Outrage in Luzon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At Laguiman&oacute;c, a port and village in the
Province of Tayabas, there resided an Englishman, Mr. H. G. Brown, who
had been many years in the Philippines. By the exercise of untiring
industry, by braving the malaria of the primeval forests, and by his
never-failing tact in dealing with the officials of the Woods and
Forests on the one hand, and with the semi-barbarous and entirely
lawless wood-cutters on the other, he had built up an extensive
business in cutting timber in the state forests of Southern Luzon and
the adjacent islands. He was owner of several sailing vessels, had a
well-appointed saw-mill, and a comfortable residence at
Languiman&oacute;c. He employed large numbers of wood-cutters; all
under advances of pay, who were scattered about the Provinces of
Tayabas, and Camarines Norte over a considerable area.</p>
<p>His business was so considerable that he paid the Government fully
$30,000 per year as royalty on timber which was mostly shipped to Hong
Kong and Shanghai.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate a business so profitable to them the
Government placed a Custom House official at Atim&oacute;nan, in the
Bay of Lamon on the Pacific coast, to clear and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>despatch
his timber vessels loaded at Atim&oacute;nan, Gumacas, Lopez, Alabat
Island, or other places. To show how little Mr. Brown spared himself, I
may mention that not even the dreaded jungle-fever of Mindoro prevented
him from personally superintending the loading of several vessels at
different ports of that pestilential island. In persistence and pluck
he was a worthy predecessor of Professor D. C. Worcester, who years
afterwards showed his Anglo-Saxon determination in the same fearsome
spot.</p>
<p>One day in December of 1884, Mr. Brown being absent in Hong Kong,
and his manager, Mr. Anderson, busy on the Pacific coast, looking after
the loading of a vessel, the out-door superintendent, a Swede named
Alfred Olsen, was in charge of the house, office, and saw-mill at
Laguiman&oacute;c, and was attending to the loading of the
<i>Tartar</i>, one of Mr. Brown&rsquo;s ships which was anchored in the
bay taking in timber for China. She had a native crew who occasionally
of an evening, when ashore to enjoy themselves, got up a disturbance
with the villagers. On board this vessel there were, as is usual, two
Carabineros or Custom House guards to prevent smuggling.</p>
<p>Although no one in the village suspected it, two large canoes full
of armed men were lying concealed behind a point in Capuluan Cove on
the opposite side of the Bay. At eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, it
being quite dark, they came across, and in perfect order, according to
a pre-arranged plan advanced in silence on the village. The assailants
numbered twenty-eight men, and were variously armed with lances,
<i>bolos</i> and daggers. Only the leader bore a revolver. A guard was
left on the canoes, four of the gang were stationed at the door of Mr.
Brown&rsquo;s house, and others at strategic points, whilst the main
body attacked the <i>Tribunal</i> close by which was also the
<i>estanco</i> where there was some Government money, postage stamps
and stamped paper. At all <i>Tribunales</i> there are a couple of
<i>cuadrilleros</i>, or village constables on guard, armed usually with
lance and <i>bolo</i>. These men did their duty and manfully resisted
the pirates. In the combat which ensued, the sergeant of the
Cuadrilleros was killed and some on both sides were wounded, but the
pirates got the best of the fight, and plundered the
<i>estanco</i>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Olsen, having heard the uproar, may have thought
that the crew of the <i>Tartar</i> were again making a disturbance. At
all events he left the house unarmed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>and unsuspicious, thus
walking into the trap laid for him. The Tagals have a great respect for
fire-arms, more especially for the revolvers and repeating rifles of
the foreigner, thus they did not venture to enter the house, but the
moment Olsen stepped out into the darkness and before he could see
round about him, he was attacked by two men on each side, who plunged
their daggers into his body, piercing his lungs. Bleeding profusely and
vomiting blood he rushed back into the house towards his bedroom to get
his revolver which was under the bed. His assailants, however, followed
him into the room and butchered him before he could grasp it. At least
the revolver was afterwards found in its case with the perfect impress
of his blood-stained hand upon the oaken lid. A native boy named Pablo,
about eight years old, was in the house at the time, and in his terror
squeezed himself into a narrow space behind the door and escaped
discovery, although he was an eye-witness of the crime.</p>
<p>By this time the alarm had spread all over the little village, and
the noise was heard on board the <i>Tartar</i>. The two Carabineros,
taking their Remingtons and cartridge boxes, had themselves paddled on
shore, and marching up the stairs which led to the rocky eminence on
which the village stands, bravely advanced against the pirates although
out-numbered by more than ten to one. They fired their rifles, but the
gang rushed upon them and in a moment they were cut down, and according
to Tagal custom, their bellies were ripped open. The pirates having now
overcome all opposition and having plundered the <i>estanco</i>, and
the inevitable Chinaman&rsquo;s shop, transferred their attention to
Mr. Brown&rsquo;s house, which they ransacked, taking the contents of
the safe, a collection of gold and silver coins, seven Martini-Henry
rifles with ammunition, and two revolvers, as well as any other things
they deemed of value. They burst open the desks, drawers, and
wardrobes, cutting and hacking the furniture with their <i>bolos</i> in
wanton mischief. Then embarking their spoil, they sailed away with the
land breeze.</p>
<p>Information had been sent off to the nearest post of the Guardia
Civil, and on its receipt, an officer with a force of that corps
instantly set off and captured one party of the pirates red-handed as
they beached their canoe. Within a week twenty-six had been captured
and one shot dead whilst escaping. There only remained the leader. He,
as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>it was afterwards discovered, was concealed in a
secluded wood a few miles from Sariaya, and one night he was speared by
the Captain of Cuadrilleros of that town, who is said to have had valid
reasons for getting him out of the way.</p>
<p>This band of pirates were a mixed lot; some of them were
<i>principales</i> or members of the town council of Sariaya, a
picturesque little place on the southern slope of Mount Banajao, and
some from San Juan de Boc-boc; others were ordinary inhabitants, a few
were outlaws from the San Juan mountains, and four or five were
fishermen whom the gang had met on their passage by sea and had invited
to accompany them. This custom of <i>Convites</i> is explained in
<a href="#ch25">Chapter XXV</a>. Of course the fishermen, when
interrogated, declared they had been pressed into the service, but in
fact very few natives have the moral courage to decline so pleasing an
entertainment, as it appeals to a feeling deeply seated in their
hearts, the love of rapine, only to be restrained by the heavy hand of
a military police &ldquo;who do not hesitate to shoot.&rdquo; The
provincial doctor arrived next morning with the judge who was to take
the depositions of the villagers and draw up the <i>sumario</i>. Olsen
was dead, the sergeant of Cuadrilleros also and one of the
<i>Carabineros</i>, but strange to say, in spite of a dozen ghastly
wounds, the other one was still alive, though his bowels were
protruding, having fallen out through the gash which it is the Tagal
custom to finish off with.</p>
<p>When the provincial doctor saw him, he said, &ldquo;Nothing can
possibly be done for him,&rdquo; and departed. So, abandoned to his own
resources, he replaced the bowels himself, and getting one of the
villagers to bind him up, he eventually recovered. He was seen by Mr.
Brown a year or two later, and is probably alive now. This seems
extraordinary, but a similar case occurred to a man who had worked
under me. An English bricklayer named John Heath had been employed
building furnaces and kilns in Manila, and having completed his work,
took to farming and rented some grass meadows (sacate lands) at
Mandaloyan. One night he and another Englishman staying with him were
attacked in his house by a party of Tagals with drawn <i>bolos</i>. The
visitor, although wounded, leaped from the window and escaped, but
Heath was cut down, then lifted on to the window sill, hacked about,
and finally, according to Tagal custom, ripped open and left for dead.
Yet this man also entirely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>recovered, and after a year seemed as
strong as ever, although he was advised not to exert his strength. This
outrage was clearly agrarian, and was, I feel sure, committed by those
who had previously rented these lands and had been turned out. No one
was ever punished for it.</p>
<p>To return to the gang of pirates; two had been killed, the rest were
in prison. Year after year passed, still they remained in prison;
judges came, stayed their term, were promoted and went, but still these
men were never sentenced.</p>
<p>In 1889, I visited Laguiman&oacute;c to make a plan and valuation of
the property, as the business was about to be taken over by a Limited
Liability Company, established in Hong Kong. This was <i>five years</i>
after the date of the murders, some of the prisoners had died in
prison, the others were awaiting their sentence. But I found that the
Government had established a sergeant&rsquo;s post of the Guardia Civil
in the village, which effectually prevented a repetition of the
outrage.</p>
<p>A year later I again visited Laguiman&oacute;c, but the trial of the
prisoners was no further advanced. No less than nine of them died in
prison, still no sentence was pronounced. Even for a Philippine Court
this was extraordinary, for the gang had committed the unpardonable
crime &ldquo;Resistencia a fuerza armada&rdquo; (Resistance to an armed
force), and could have been tried by Court-martial and summarily shot.
They had also dared to lay their profane hands on the sacred money-box
containing a portion of the &ldquo;Real Haber&rdquo; (Government
money), so that it was not only a question of murder and robbery of
private people. But the Civil Court, negligent, slothful, and corrupt,
could not be got to convict, and a few years ago, Mr. Brown having left
the islands, the surviving prisoners were <i>pardoned</i> by the Queen
Regent on the occasion of the young King&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>The contrast between the military and civil elements in this case is
very strong.</p>
<p>The military element performed its duties thoroughly well, under
great difficulties, and promptly arrested the malefactors. In my
experience this has been always the case, and I draw from it the
conclusion that military Government is essential to the pacification of
the Philippines and that authority must be backed up by a native
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>force of constabulary under American officers who
must be young and active.</p>
<p>Such offences as piracy or gang-robbery should never come before a
Civil Court, but should be promptly settled by court-martial before
which no technicalities or legal subtleties need be taken into
account.</p>
<p>A firm, nay, a heavy hand over the Philippines is the most merciful
in the long run.</p>
<p>I am sorry to have to relate that the Company which took over Mr.
Brown&rsquo;s business did not long prosper. Whilst he remained at the
head of it, all went well, but as soon as he left to take a much-needed
rest, it began to fail. The personality of the individual is everything
in most Spanish countries and especially in the Philippines. No manager
could be found who could keep on terms with the officials, control the
wild wood-cutters or risk jungle-fever by entering the forests to
personally inspect the work.</p>
<p>The organization decayed and the business went to pieces. Let
intending investors take note. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Spanish Colonial system was based upon the simple
and well-recognised principle of rewarding political services to the
Government in power, by the pillage of a colony.</p>
<p>Sometimes special circumstances rendered it necessary for the
Government to send out the man best fitted to cope with a critical
situation, but in normal times the good old corrupt plan was
followed.</p>
<p>The appointment of a Governor-General would be arranged by the Prime
Minister and submitted for the approval of the monarch. The Colonial
Minister, like the other subordinate ministers, counted for little in a
Cabinet presided over by such commanding personalities as
C&aacute;novas, or Sag&aacute;sta. They were, in fact, mere heads of
departments.</p>
<p>In another chapter I have remarked that it was generally believed
that General Weyler purchased his appointment as Governor-General of
the Philippines, by a cash payment and an annual subsidy.</p>
<p>There were, however, certain officials whom it would be unjust to
class with those who practically had to rob for their living, because
they were subject to dismissal at any moment. These unfortunates knew
perfectly well that integrity and ability would not ensure them a
single day&rsquo;s grace. Whenever the man in power wanted that place
for his cousin or his uncle, out they would go. Similarly, if
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>they had any interest, misbehaviour would not lose
the appointment. Considering the system, the wonder was that some of
them were honest, not that most of them were thieves.</p>
<p>Amongst those who had fixed appointments were the Inspector-General
of Forests and his assistants. Every British and American resident in,
or visitor to Manila, will remember a Catalan gentleman, Don Sebastian
Vidal y Soler and his charming wife Dona Ella Paoli de Vidal, a lady
from Philadelphia. Vidal was a man of great learning and equal modesty,
a man of the strictest honour, kind-hearted and charitable in the
extreme. He was well-known in America, in London, Paris, and Amsterdam,
and wherever botanists congregate. His death in 1890 was universally
regretted.</p>
<p>In the same branch of the service there was another gentleman whom I
must name. Don Jos&eacute; Sainz de Baranda, at one time acting
Colonial Secretary, is a most courteous gentleman, whose high character
and marked ability were well worthy of the confidence reposed in him by
General Terrero. Any country might be proud to own Se&ntilde;or Sainz
de Baranda. For my part I preserve the most agreeable remembrances of
these two friends.</p>
<p>In the Department of Public Works there were men of considerable
attainments as engineers&mdash;Don Eduardo Lopez Navarro, author of the
project for the new harbour; Don Genaro Palacios, who designed and
carried out the waterworks and designed the Church of Saint Sebastian,
in both of which works I took part; and Se&ntilde;or Brockman, who
constructed several lighthouses in different parts of the Archipelago.
I feel bound to say that so far as my knowledge went, there was no
corruption or underhand work in either the Inspection of Forests or the
Public Works.</p>
<p>As to the patronage of other civil offices I have had the procedure
explained to me by a Spaniard well up in the subject, and I give an
imaginary instance to illustrate the system.</p>
<p>When a political party came into power and the question of forming
the Cabinet was being debated, Se&ntilde;or M&mdash;&mdash;, a leader
of a group of deputies, might say, &ldquo;I renounce the honour of
entering the Cabinet, and instead will take the Presidency of the
Chamber and the right to appoint the Collector of Customs at Havana,
the Intendant General of Hacienda at Manila, and the Governor of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>Batangas, with a dozen second and third class
governorships or judgeships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this was agreed to, perhaps, after some haggling, Se&ntilde;or
M&mdash;&mdash; distributed the nominations to the lower appointments
amongst his supporters, who disposed of them for their own
advantage.</p>
<p>The nominations to the higher offices remained the absolute private
property of Se&ntilde;or M&mdash;&mdash;, and he proceeded to pick out
men up to the job, to undertake the appointments. Some of them paid him
large sums in cash, and others entered into contracts binding
themselves to remit him monthly a large proportion of their emoluments
and pickings. In some cases it was stipulated that if a single payment
was in default, the unfortunate employ&eacute; would be instantly
dismissed. I have personally known of this condition. Those he
nominated referred to him as their <i>padrino</i> or godfather.</p>
<p>The actual holders of the offices referred to would then be
summarily dismissed, however well they might have behaved whilst
serving, and the new horde would be installed in their places and would
use every means to fill their pockets and to pay their
<i>padrino</i>.</p>
<p>Complaints against them were not likely to lead to their removal,
for they were protected in Madrid by the powerful political interest of
their <i>padrino</i>. If they kept within the criminal law, they had
little to fear, however greedy they might be.</p>
<p>Some of the governors and other officials had the talent of filling
their pockets without making enemies. I have already referred to a
Governor of Batangas, as eminent in this line. It must not be supposed
that the illicit gains of the officials were extorted from the
individual native. They were principally drawn from the <i>fallos</i>,
or local tax in redemption of <i>polos</i> or personal service. This
money ought to have been employed in repairing roads, bridges, and
public buildings. But as nearly the whole was diverted into the pockets
of the officials and their <i>padrinos</i>, the roads became impassable
in the wet season, the bridges, if of wood, rotted, if of stone, were
thrown down by the earthquakes or carried away by floods, whilst the
tribunales (town halls), fell into decay. I have known cases where a
planter has been unable for months to send his sugar down to the port
for shipment, as it was absolutely impossible for carts to pass along
the road in the wet season. In a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51"
href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>wealthy and populous province
like Batangas, the <i>fallos</i> were sufficient to have paved all the
main roads in the province with granite and to have bridged every
stream.</p>
<p>I may mention here a characteristic trait of Spanish administration.
When a river-bridge fell down, they not only did not repair or renew
it, but they put up to auction the monopoly of ferrying vehicles and
passengers across the stream. The purchaser of the right fastened a
rattan across the river and provided a couple of canoes with a platform
of cane laid over them, which served to ferry vehicles across by means
of the rope; one or two at a time at a rather heavy charge. This truly
Spanish method provided a revenue for the Administration, or pickings
for an official, instead of requiring an outlay for a new bridge.</p>
<p>Still, the natives, never having known anything better, supported
these drawbacks with remarkable equanimity. They were left very much to
themselves, and were not interfered with nor worried. The army was
small and the conscription did not press heavily upon them.</p>
<p>They lived under the &ldquo;Leyes de Indias&rdquo; (may their makers
have found favour with God), a code of laws deserving of the greatest
praise for wisdom and humanity. They protected the native against
extortion, constituting him a perpetual minor as against the usurer. He
could not be sued for more than five dollars. Compare this wise
disposition with what has been going on in India ever since the British
Government has administered it, where the principal occupation of the
lower courts is to decree the foreclosure of mortgages on the
ryot&rsquo;s patches of land at the suit of the village usurer. The
result has been that in some provinces the small landowner class who
furnished fighting men for the Indian Army has almost disappeared. It
is only now in 1900 that something is proposed to be done to remedy
this evil, and knowing my countrymen, I quite expect some weak-kneed
compromise will be arrived at.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Leyes de Indias&rdquo; conferred upon the native the
perpetual usufruct of any land that he kept under cultivation; and this
right descended from father to son.</p>
<p>As a result of these laws, most of the arable land in Luzon,
Ceb&uacute;, and some other islands belongs to the natives to this day,
although many of them have no other title than possession. The natives
also had the privilege of cutting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52"
href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>timber in the forests for
house-building or repairing, or for making a canoe free of dues. They
could also cut bamboos for their fences or roofs and collect
firewood.</p>
<p>These privileges were restricted to natives, and were not extended
to Spaniards or Chinese. The taxes paid by the natives were light and
they could live and thrive.</p>
<p>Had these wise and admirable laws been carried out in the spirit in
which they were made, the Philippines might have been Spanish to this
day and the natives would have had little to complain of.</p>
<p>The Philippines were for nearly three centuries after their
discovery by the Spaniards a mere dependency of Mexico, communication
being kept up by an annual galleon or sometimes two sailing between
Acapulco and Manila through the Strait of San Bernardino. The long and
tedious voyage deterred all but priests and officials from proceeding
to the Philippines.</p>
<p>When this route was given up, which happened some ten years before
the Independence of Mexico, which was proclaimed in 1820, communication
with the Peninsula was by sailing vessels via the Cape of Good Hope.
That was a voyage that would not be lightly undertaken either going or
returning. Spaniards who then came to the Archipelago often stayed
there for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the establishment of a
line of steamers bringing Manila within thirty days of Barcelona was
the most important event in the history of the Philippines since the
conquest, and it had the gravest consequences. It greatly stimulated
the trade of the Philippines, but it enormously increased the number of
Spaniards in the Islands. Hordes of hungry-looking Iberians arrived by
every steamer with nominations to posts for which most of them
possessed no qualification. It seemed as if all the loafers of the
Puerta del Sol and the Calle de Alcal&aacute; were to be dumped in the
Philippines and fed by the Treasury.</p>

</div>
<p>Places had to be found for them, and a bureaucratic administration
partly copied from French practice, was rapidly substituted for the old
paternal r&eacute;gime. New departments were organised or the old ones
greatly extended. Far more money was spent on the salaries of engineers
and assistant-engineers than on public works. The salaries of the
officials of the Woods and Forests exceeded the revenue derived from
dues on timber cut in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53"
name="pb53">53</a>]</span>the Crown forests, and their regulations
seriously interfered with the privileges of the natives previously
mentioned, and caused great discontent. The salaries of the Inspectors
of Mines were almost a useless expense, for there was no revenue
derived from mines, in fact there were no mines, only placers and
washings. A medical service was organised at great cost and to little
advantage. Doctors were appointed to reside at the hot springs, and one
could not take a bath there without paying a fee. Model farms and
Schools of Agriculture were started, to find places for more Spaniards,
for the officials received their salaries, but no funds were
forthcoming for material or establishment.</p>
<p>In 1886 there took place the separation of the executive and the
judicial functions, and eighteen civil governors were appointed to the
principal provinces. Later on, eighteen judges of first instance were
nominated to these same provinces. After centuries of rule, the
Alcaldes Mayores were abolished.</p>
<p>Then came a period when certain bureaucrats in Madrid conceived what
they thought a vast and patriotic idea. They founded a school of
politicians who called themselves <i>Asimilistas</i>. Their grand idea
was to assimilate the administration of the Philippines to that of the
Mother Country. They thought it wise to assimilate the institutions of
a tropical dependency with eight millions of native inhabitants, of
whom one-sixth part were independent heathen or Mahometans, to the
gradually evolved institutions of Old Spain.</p>
<p>By way of a commencement they began to speak and write of the
Philippines as &ldquo;that beautiful province of Spain.&rdquo; The
Philippine army had always been distinct from the Peninsular army, but
now by a paper reform it was embodied in it, and the regiments were
re-numbered, the 1st Visayas Regiment becoming the 74th, etc. This was
considered to be a strong link to bind together the Mother Country and
the Colony.</p>
<p>The extra expense of these crowds of employ&eacute;s and of some
expeditions to Mindanao and Jol&oacute; was very heavy, accordingly
every year saw some new and oppressive tax. In 1883 the
&ldquo;Tributo,&rdquo; or tribute that had been paid by the natives
since the conquest, was replaced by a tax on the C&eacute;dula
Personal, or document of identity, and this was paid by all adults of
both sexes, whether Spaniards, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"
href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>foreigners, or half-castes. In
the Appendix will be found a facsimile of my c&eacute;dula.</p>
<p>The Customs duties were several times raised, sometimes without much
notice. A tax on all trades and professions, on horses and carriages, a
heavy port tax, a vexatious tax on all animals slaughtered, even down
to a sucking pig, taxes on the hand-looms used by the women in their
spare time, taxes on sugar-mills, rice-mills, on boats and lighters,
and on houses; all these and many more were collected.</p>
<p>There were also serious agrarian disputes between the Dominicans,
the Augustinians, and the tenants on their estates, owing to excessive
rents demanded by the friars. All these circumstances brought about a
great change in the relations between the Spaniards and the natives.
Whereas formerly the wealthy native kept open house on feast days, and
received with pleasure the visits of Spaniards, generally elderly men
used to the country and speaking the language of the people, he now
found his house invaded by a crowd of young officials new to the
country and its ways, who fell on the eatables like a swarm of
famishing locusts, and soon devoured the turkeys and hams and other
good things he had provided to entertain his friends. Besides, his
women-folk would probably not be treated by the new-comers with the
courtesy and consideration they had been used to.</p>
<p>An estrangement gradually made itself felt, and increased year by
year, in direct proportion to the influx of Spaniards. Not one in a
hundred of these did any useful work or added in any way to the wealth
of the community. They were the drones of the hive, and were in fact
directly harmful, for they had to be supported from the Treasury, and
they irritated the natives by their illegal exactions and overbearing
conduct whenever they came in contact with them.</p>
<p>Still year after year passed without disturbances. From 1877 to
1892, whilst I was in the country, I can testify that almost perfect
order reigned. The fighting in Mindanao and Jol&oacute; went on as a
matter of course like the Acheen war in Sumatra, and an expedition was
sent against the Igorrotes. But in the civilised districts of Luzon and
Visayas good order was kept. The only outbreak I remember was the
religious excitement in Samar, which closed when the false gods were
shot down. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span></p>
<p>Crime was infrequent, and in those fourteen years I do not think
half-a-dozen executions took place. There was less risk of burglary in
Manila than in a London suburb. Whatever their faults I must give the
Spanish Administration credit for the perfect order they kept. Manila,
in this respect, compared favourably with Hong Kong, and still better
with Singapore, where the authorities, perhaps remembering the fate of
Governor Eyre of Jamaica, and in terror of Exeter Hall, tolerated the
incredible insolence of the Chinese secret societies. These villainous
organisations, which in Singapore successfully defied the law, never
raised their heads in Manila, and Rajah Brooke showed how to treat them
in Sarawak.</p>
<p>In pursuance of the <i>Asimilista</i> policy, in July 1887, the
Penal Code was put in force in the Philippines by peremptory order from
the Government at Madrid, and much against the opinion of experienced
officials. In December of the same year the Civil Code was
promulgated.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that these reforms, however well-intended,
produced any beneficial effect on the natives. Combined with the great
increase in taxation, they intensified the discontent that was always
smouldering, more especially in the hearts of the native priests. Their
grievances against the religious orders, and more particularly against
the Recollets, who had been compensated for the handing over of their
benefices in Mindanao to the Jesuits, at the expense of the secular
clergy, were the cause of their bitter hatred of the Spanish
friars.</p>
<p>In 1883 Field-Marshal Jovellar had thought it necessary to
strengthen the small garrison by bringing out two battalions of Marine
Infantry. However it was not till March 1st, 1888, that some natives
and mestizos, emboldened by the fact that an anti-clerical, D. Jose
Centeno, a mining engineer, was Acting Civil Governor of Manila, walked
in procession to his official residence and presented a petition
addressed to the Governor-General, demanding the immediate expulsion of
the friars of the religious orders, and of the Archbishop, whom they
declared unworthy to occupy the Primacy of the Islands. They further
demanded the secularisation of the benefices and the confiscation of
the estates of the Augustinians and the Dominicans.</p>
<p>To this petition there were 810 signatures, but when the signatories
were summoned and examined, most of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56"
href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>them (as is their custom)
declared they did not know what they had signed, and denied that they
wished the friars to be expelled.</p>
<p>The petition was said to have been written by Doroteo Cortes, a
mestizo lawyer, but I am told he did not sign it.</p>
<p>This manifestation, sixteen years after the mutiny at Cavite, seems
to have had some relation to that event, for the petition accused the
friars of compassing the death of Father Burgos, by subornation of
justice.</p>
<p>The result of this appeal of the natives was that the principal
persons who took part in it were banished, or sent to reside at
undesirable spots within the Archipelago.</p>
<p>There were some agrarian disturbances at Calamba and Santa Rosa, one
of the estates of the Dominicans, in 1890.</p>
<p>I may say that only the Augustinians, the Dominicans, and the
Recollets possess landed estates, and that I have had the opportunity
of examining several of them. They are all situated in Tagal territory,
and as they are the pick of the lands, their possession by the friars
has caused great heart-burnings amongst the Tagals&mdash;there has been
a smouldering agrarian discontent for years. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before referring further to these estates it may be as
well to give a brief sketch of the religious orders, whose existence is
bound up with the history of the Philippines, to the conversion and
civilisation of which they have so largely contributed. They won the
islands for Spain, they held them for centuries, and now, having served
their purpose, they have lost them, doubtless for ever.</p>
<p>The Augustinians were the pioneers in converting the inhabitants of
the Philippines, and they have maintained their predominance ever
since.</p>
<p>I therefore begin my description with this venerable order, and it
will be proper to say something about its glorious founder.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>The following data are taken from the &lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica&rsquo; and other sources.</p>
<p>Augustine (Aurelius Augustinus) one of the four great fathers of the
Latin Church, and admittedly the greatest of the four, was born at
Tagaste (Tajelt), a town of Numidia, North Africa, <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 354. His father, Patricius, was a burgess of this
town, and was still a pagan at the time of his son&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p>His mother, M&oacute;nica, was not only a Christian, but a woman of
the most elevated, tender, and devoted piety, whose affectionate and
beautiful enthusiasm have passed into a touching type of womanly
saintliness for all ages.</p>
<p>Augustine studied rhetoric at Madaura and Carthage, and visited Rome
and Milan.</p>
<p>He passed many years in unrest of mind and doubt, but ultimately a
passage from Romans xii. 13, 14 seemed to pour the light of peace into
his heart. He became a Christian and was baptised in his thirty-third
year. Patricius was also converted and baptised, and Monica found the
desire of her life fulfilled and her dear ones united to her in
faith.</p>
<p>After some years of retirement, Augustine made a journey to Hippo
Regius, a Roman colony on the River Rubricatus in North Africa, and
became a presbyter.</p>
<p>His principal writings are &lsquo;The City of God,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Confessions,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Trinity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He died during the siege of Hippo by the Vandals at the age of
75.</p>
<p>The theological position and influence of Augustine may be said to
be unrivalled. No single name has ever exercised such power over the
Christian Church, and no one mind has ever made such an impression upon
Christian thought.</p>
<p>The Augustinians look upon this great Christian moralist as their
founder, and reverence his memory and that of his saintly mother.</p>
<p>Whether he personally drew up the rules they observe or not, they
were his disciples, following in his foot-steps, and finding their
inspiration in his writings and example.</p>
<p>Great indeed must have been the magnetic force of that vehement
nature that it could give an impetus to his followers that carried them
all over Europe, that made them the companions of the discoverers and
conquerors of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>the New World, and that filled their hearts with
zeal and courage to face the dangers of the great lone ocean in company
with Villalobos and Leg&aacute;spi.</p>
<p>The Order traces its inception to the town of Hippo, and fixes the
date at <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 395. Many, doubtless, were its
vicissitudes, but in the year 1061, and again in 1214, we find the
Order remodelled and extended. The Augustinians were very numerous in
England and Scotland. In 1105 they had settled at Colchester and at
Nostell, near Pontefract. Later they had abbeys at Bristol, Llantony,
Christchurch, Twynham, Bolton and London, where part of their church
(Austin Friars) is still standing. Altogether they had 170 houses in
England. Their first house in Scotland was at Scone in 1114, and they
soon had 25 houses, including churches or abbeys at Inchcolm in the
Firth of Forth, St Andrew&rsquo;s, Holyrood, Cambuskenneth and
Inchaffray.</p>
<p>The Austin Friars or Black Canons were then described as an order of
regular clergy holding a middle position between monks and secular
canons, almost resembling a community of parish priests living under
rule, and they have retained these characteristics to the present
day.</p>
<p>They were numerous in Spain, and some of the other Orders, such as
the Dominicans or Preaching Friars, the Franciscans, and the Recollets,
may almost be looked upon as offshoots of this venerable order, for
they conformed to its general rule, with certain additions. Thus the
Dominicans, founded by Saint Dominic de Guzman, were incorporated in
1216 by a Bull of Pope Honorius III. and adopted a rule of absolute
poverty or mendicancy in addition to the usual vows of chastity and
obedience.</p>
<p>This Order held its first chapter in 1220 at Bologna, under the
presidency of its founder.</p>
<p>The vows of poverty of this powerful Order have not prevented it
from holding large estates in the Philippines, from owning blocks of
buildings in Manila and Hong Kong, and from having a huge sum invested
in British and American securities. These however belong to the
Corporation and not to the individual members.</p>
<p>From Spain the Augustinians spread to Mexico and assisted the
Franciscans, who were the pioneers there under Father Bartolom&eacute;
de Olm&eacute;do and Father Martin de Valencia, to gather in the
abundant harvest. Father Toribio de Benav&eacute;nte was one of twelve
Franciscans sent out in 1523, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href=
"#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>and he has left records of the
success of these missionaries. They opened schools and founded
colleges, and in twenty years nine millions of converts had been
admitted into the Christian fold.</p>
<p>By this time Magellan had passed the narrow straits, and sailing
across the vast solitudes of the Pacific had reached the Visayas
Islands to meet his fate, and Sebastian de Elcano had completed the
circumnavigation of the globe and had arrived in Spain with accounts of
the new lands which the expedition had discovered.</p>
<p>When, in 1542, Captain Ruy Lopez de Villalobos sailed from Natividad
(Mexico) for the Islands of the Setting Sun, only to die of grief at
Amboyna, there accompanied him a group of Augustinian Friars. After the
loss of his vessels the survivors took ship for Goa and from thence
returned to Europe, arriving at Lisbon in August 1549, <i>seven
years</i> after leaving the port of Natividad.</p>
<p>The Order has carefully preserved the names of these early
missionaries; they are, Frs. Jeronimo de San Esteban, Sebastian de
Trasierra, Nicolas de Perea, Alonso Alvarado.</p>
<p>In the expedition under General Don Miguel Lopez de Leg&aacute;spi,
which sailed in 1564, Fray Andres Urdan&eacute;ta, an Augustinian, went
as chief navigator and cartographer, and the following friars
accompanied him: Frs. Andres de Aiguirre, Martin de Rada, Diego
Herrero, Pedro Gamboa.</p>
<p>Since founding the city of Ceb&uacute; in 1570, and the city of
Manila the following year, the Augustinians have continued to found
town after town, and down to 1892 had founded no less than two hundred
and forty-two, administered by two hundred and forty-seven priests of
the Order as by the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p>In former years this Order had established missions in Japan, and
they were very successful in making converts, but during the
persecution many members of the Order lost their lives, or, as they
phrase it, &ldquo;attained the palm of martyrdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the present time they maintain seven missionaries in the province
of Hun-nan in China. In Spain they support three colleges, Valladolid,
La Vid, and La Escorial. They are also in charge of the magnificent
church of that extraordinary palace, and of the priceless library of
which they are editing a catalogue.</p>
<p>The Augustinians have published a great many works, such as grammars
and vocabularies of the native dialects, and many books of
devotion.</p>
<p>One of their leading men, Father Manuel Blanco, was a most learned
and laborious botanist. He collected and classified so many of the
Philippine plants that the Order decided to complete his work and
publish it. Fray Andres Naves and Fray Celestino Fernandez Villar, both
well-known to me, worked for years at this, and were assisted by my
illustrious friend H. E. Don Sebastian Vidal Soler and others.</p>
<p>The result is a most sumptuous and magnificent work&mdash;published
in Manila&mdash;there being four folio volumes enriched by many
hundreds of coloured plates of the different trees, shrubs, orchids and
lianas, most beautifully executed from water-colour paintings by D.
Regino Garcia and others. This monumental book is called the
&lsquo;Flora Filipina.&rsquo; It received a diploma of honour at the
International Colonial Exhibition of Amsterdam in 1883. The British
Museum <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>possesses a copy, but unfortunately most of the
work was destroyed by fire in the bombardment of the Convent of
Guadalupe during the war.</p>
<p>However, the widow of Se&ntilde;or Vidal, now Mrs. Amilon of
Philadelphia, still has some copies to dispose of.</p>
<p>I hope that what I have said about the Augustinians will show that
they are not the lazy and unprofitable persons they are sometimes
represented. The same may be said of the Dominicans.</p>
<p>The Augustinians were followed, after an interval of seven years, by
the Franciscans, four years after that by the Jesuits, six years after
the Jesuits came the Dominicans.</p>
<p>Last of all came the Recollets, or bare-footed Augustinians.</p>
<p>The following Table gives the numbers of friars of the five
religious orders in the Philippines, at the dates mentioned, taken from
their own returns. The first column gives the dates of the first
foundation of the Order, the second the date of its arrival in the
Archipelago. The other columns give the statistics of baptisms,
marriages and deaths, taken from the parish registers.</p>

<p>These holy men have, since very early times, shown themselves rather
turbulent, and then and always endeavoured to carry matters with a high
hand. Thus in 1582 we find them refusing to admit the diocesan visit of
the Bishop of Manila, and that old dispute has cropped up on and off
many times since then. At the same time we find them taking the part of
the natives against the <i>Encomenderos</i>. They have always been
ready to fight for their country and to subscribe money for its
defence. When Acting Governor Guido de Lavezares headed the column
which attacked the pirate Li-ma-Hon, he was accompanied by the
Provincial of the Augustinians. In 1603 all the friars in Manila took
up arms against the revolted Chinese, and three years later the
Augustinians not only furnished a war ship to fight the Portuguese, but
provided a captain for it in the person of one of their Order, Fray
Antonio Flores. It appears that the estates of the Augustinians and the
Dominicans were very early a bone of contention, for in 1689 a judge
arrived in Manila, and, in virtue of a special commission he had
brought from Madrid, he required them to present their titles. This
they refused to do, and the judge was sent back to Mexico, and a friend
of the friars was appointed as Commissioner in his place. Then the
friars condescended to unofficially exhibit their titles. Now more than
two centuries after the first abortive attempt, the question of the
ownership of these lands is still under discussion.</p>
<p>During the British occupation of Manila in 1763 the friars took up
arms in defence of their flag, and gave their church bells to be cast
into cannon. No less than ten Augustinians fell on the field of battle.
The British treated them with great severity, sacking and destroying
their rectories and estate houses, and selling everything of theirs
they could lay hands on. I have visited the ruins of the old estate
house of Malinta which was burnt by the British.</p>
<p>In 1820, when the massacre of foreigners by the Manila mob took
place, owing the cowardice of General Folgueras, the archbishop and
friars marched out in procession to the scene of the disturbance and
succeeded in saving many lives. In 1851 a Recollet, Father
Iba&ntilde;ez, raised a battalion from his congregation, trained and
commanded it. He took the field at Mindanao and with the most undaunted
bravery led his men to the assault of a Moro Cotta, or fort, dying
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>like our General Wolfe at the moment of victory.
Not one man of this battalion ever deserted or hung back from the
combats, for the worthy priest had all their wives under a solemn vow
never to receive them again unless they returned victorious from the
campaign.</p>
<p>The religious orders have frequently interfered to protect the
natives against the civil authorities, and were often on very good
terms with the mass of their parishioners. The greatest jealousy of
them was felt by the native clergy.</p>
<p>The military revolt which broke out in Cavite in 1872, was doubtless
inspired by this class, who saw that a policy had been adopted of
filling vacancies in all benefices except the poorest, with Spanish
friars instead of natives. The condemnation of Burgos, Gomez, and
Zamora, three native priests who were executed at Manila soon after the
suppression of the revolt, is ascribed by the natives and mestizos to
the subornation of justice to the friars, who are said to have paid a
large sum for their condemnation.</p>
<p>However this may be, there is no doubt that since that date the
feeling against the friars has become intensified.</p>
<p>The friars were the chief outposts and even bulwarks of the
government against rebellions. Almost every rising has been detected by
them, many plots being revealed by women under the seal of confession.
It was only by the assistance of the friars that the islands were held
by Spain for so many centuries almost without any military force.</p>
<p>The islands were not conquered by force of arms&mdash;the people
were converted almost without firing a shot.</p>
<p>The greater part of the fighting was to protect the natives against
Chinese pirates, Japanese corsairs, Dutch rovers, or the predatory
heathen.</p>
<p>The defensive forces consisted of local troops and companies of
Mexican and Peruvian Infantry. It is only since 1828 that Manila has
been garrisoned by regular troops from the Peninsula.</p>
<p>During my residence in the islands I do not think there were more
than 1500 Spanish troops in garrison in the whole islands, except when
some marines were sent out. These troops belonged to the Peninsular
Regiment of Artillery, and were a very fine looking set of men.</p>
<p>That this small force could be sufficient is evidently <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>due to
the influence of the friars in keeping the people quiet.</p>
<p>Yet the feeling of a great majority of Spanish civilians was against
the friars, and I think many of those who supported them, only did so
from interested motives.</p>
<p>The consequence was that as the number of Spaniards increased, the
influence of the friars diminished, for the Spanish anti-clericals had
no scruples in criticising the priests and in speaking plainly to the
natives to their prejudice.</p>
<p>The friars have fared badly at the hands of several writers on the
Philippines; but it will be noticed that those who know the least about
them speak the worst of them.</p>
<p>Herr Jagor, who was much amongst them, bears witness to the strict
decorum of their households, whilst he very justly says that the
behaviour of the native clergy leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p>Foreman hints at horrors, and with questionable taste relates how he
found amongst a priest&rsquo;s baggage some very obscene pictures.</p>
<p>Worcester thinks the priests&rsquo; influence wholly bad. From what
he states in his book, he must have come across some very bad specimens
amongst the smaller islands where he wandered.</p>
<p>Younghusband, who perhaps got his information at the bar of the
Manila Club, describes them as &ldquo;monsters of lechery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a tradition that when the conclusions of a tribunal
favourable to the canonisation of Santa Rosa de Lima, Patroness of the
Indies, were laid before Pope Clement X., that Pontiff manifested his
incredulity that a tropical climate could produce a saint. He is even
credited with the saying that bananas and saints are not grown
together.</p>
<p>The tradition may be erroneous, but there is something in the
opinion that deserves to be remembered.</p>
<p>Temperature does have something to do with sexual morality, and in
comparing one country with another an allowance must be made for the
height of the thermometer.</p>
<p>The friars in the Philippines are but men, and men exposed to great
temptations. We should remember the tedium of life in a provincial
town, where, perhaps, the parish priest is the only European, and is
surfeited with the conversation of his native curates, of the
half-caste <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>apothecary and the Chinese store-keeper. He has
neither society nor amusement.</p>
<p>I have previously remarked upon the position of women in the
Philippines. I may repeat that their position, both by law and custom,
is at least as good as in the most advanced countries.</p>
<p>I remember reading with great interest, and, perhaps, some sympathy,
a remarkable article in the <i>New York Herald</i>, of January 10th,
1894, headed &ldquo;Virtue Defined,&rdquo; signed by Tennie C. Claflin
(Lady Cook), and it seemed to me a plea for &ldquo;equality of
opportunity&rdquo; between the sexes, if I may borrow the phrase from
diplomacy. Well, that equality exists in the Philippines. Whilst
unmarried, the girls enjoy great freedom. In that tolerant land a
little ante-nuptial incontinence is not an unpardonable crime in a girl
any more than in a youth, nor does it bar the way to marriage.</p>
<p>The girls whilst young possess exceedingly statuesque figures, and
what charms they have are nature&rsquo;s own, for they owe nothing to
art. Their dress is modest, yet as they do not wear a superfluity of
garments, at times, as when bathing, their figures are revealed to
view.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the above condition of things and that the priest is
the principal man in the town and able to do many favours to his
friends, it is not surprising if some of the young women, impelled by
the desire of obtaining his good graces, make a dead set at him, such
as we sometimes see made at a bachelor curate in our own
so-very-much-more frigid and, therefore, moral country. The priest,
should he forget his vows of celibacy, is a sinner, and deserving of
blame for failing to keep the high standard of virtue which his Church
demands. But I do not see in that a justification for calling him a
monster. Have we never heard of a backslider in Brooklyn, or of a
clerical co-respondent at home, that we should expect perfection in the
Philippines? As for the statements that the priests take married women
by force, that is an absurdity. The Tagals are not men to suffer such
an outrage.</p>
<p>The toleration enjoyed by the girls, above referred to, is a
heritage from heathen times, which three centuries of Christianity have
failed to extirpate. In fact, this is a characteristic of the Malay
race.</p>
<p>During the many years I was in the islands I had frequent occasion
to avail myself of the hospitality of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>priests on my journeys.
This was usually amongst the Augustinians, the Dominicans and the
Recollets. I declare that on none of those many occasions did I ever
witness anything scandalous, or indecorous in their convents, and I
arrived at all hours and without notice.</p>
<p>As to Younghusband&rsquo;s denouncement of them as &ldquo;monsters
of lechery,&rdquo; I would say that they were notoriously the most
healthy and the longest-lived people in the islands, and if that most
unjust accusation was true, this could hardly be the case. It should be
remembered that the priest of any large town would be a man advanced in
years and therefore less likely to misconduct himself.</p>
<p>There was also the certainty that any open scandal would be followed
by punishment from the provincial and council of the order. I have
known a priest to be practically banished to a wretched hamlet amongst
savages for two years for causing scandal.</p>
<p>Some late writers speak of the native clergy as if they were of
superior morality and better behaved than the Spanish priests. That
appreciation does <span class="corr" id="xd20e3820" title=
"Source: no">not</span> commend itself to those who have had some
experience of the Philippine clergy.</p>
<p>Some of those I have known were of very relaxed morals, not to say
scandalous in their behaviour. The Philippine Islands, in short, are
not the chosen abode of chastity: but I do not know why the Spanish
friars should be singled out for special censure in this respect.</p>
<p>I can truly say that I was not acquainted with any class out there
entitled to cast the first stone.</p>
<p>Each of the orders (except the Jesuits) is a little republic
governed or administered by officers and functionaries elected by the
suffrages of the members. The head of the order is a Superior or
General, who resides in Rome, but the head in the Philippines is called
the Provincial.</p>
<p>The brethren render him the greatest respect and obedience, kneeling
down to kiss his hand.</p>
<p>There is a council to assist the provincial, they are called
definidores or padres graves, the exact nomenclature varies in the
different orders.</p>
<p>There is a Procurator or Commissary in Madrid, a Procurator-General
in Manila, a Prior or Guardian to each convent not being a rectory, an
Orator or preacher, lay-brethren in charge of estates or of works,
parish priests, missionaries, and coadjutors, learning the native
dialects. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>The members of the order were appointed to benefices according to
their standing and popularity amongst their brethren. The neophytes are
trained in one of the seminaries of the order in Spain; for instance,
the Augustinians have colleges at Valladolid, La Vid, and La Escorial,
with more than 300 students.</p>
<p>When a young priest first arrived in the Philippines, he was sent as
a coadjutor to some parish priest to learn the dialect of the people he
is to work amongst. Then he would be appointed a missionary to the
heathen, where he lived on scanty pay, amongst savages, either in the
highlands of Luzon or in some remote island, remaining there for two or
three years. His first promotion would be to a parish consisting of a
village of thatched houses (nipa) and, perhaps, the church and convent
would be of the same material. This meant a constant and imminent dread
of the almost instantaneous destruction of his dwelling by fire.
Perhaps there is communication with Manila once a month, when, by
sending to the nearest port, he may get letters and newspapers and
receive some provisions, an occasional cask of Spanish red wine, some
tins of chorizos (Estreme&ntilde;o smoked sausages), a sack of
garbanzos, or frij&oacute;les, a box of turron de Alicante, and some
cigars from the procuration of the convent in Manila. These would be
charged to his account, and frugally as he might live, many a year
might pass over his head before he would be out of debt to his Order.
And poor as he might be, he would never refuse his house or his table
to any European who might call upon him. Later on, if his conduct had
satisfied his superiors, the time would come when he would get
nominated to a more accessible and more profitable parish, that would
quickly enable him to pay off the debt due to the procuration. He would
have a church and convent of stone, keep a carriage and pair of ponies,
and begin to have a surplus, and to contribute a little to the funds of
his Order.</p>
<p>Soon he would become Padre Grave, and begin to have influence with
his colleagues. He would be removed to a richer town and nominated
Vicario For&aacute;neo, equivalent to an archdeacon in England. Later
on, he might be elected a Definidor, or councillor. Then, perhaps, one
of the great prizes of the order fell to his lot. He might be appointed
parish priest of Taal or Bi&ntilde;an, worth at least ten thousand
dollars a year, or of rich Lipa, high amongst its coffee groves (now,
alas! withered), which used to be worth twenty <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>thousand
dollars in a good year. He would treat himself well, and liberally
entertain all who visited him, and governors of provinces, judges,
officers of the Guardia Civil, would often be seen at his table.</p>
<p>He would make large contributions to the funds of the Order, with
the surplus revenue of his parish.</p>
<p>If, however, the priest whose career we have been following, had
shown sufficient character for a champion, and had become popular in
the Order, he might, perhaps, be elected Provincial, and then,
disposing of the influence of his Order, some day get himself made a
Bishop or even Archbishop of Manila, should a vacancy occur, and so
become a prince of the Church.</p>
<p>Whatever talents a friar had, a sphere could always be found for
their exercise. If he had a gift for preaching, he could be appointed
Orator of the Order. If he was good at Latin and Greek, he could be
made a professor at the university. If he was a good business man, he
could be chosen procurator. If he had diplomatic talents<span class=
"corr" id="xd20e3851" title="Not in source">,</span> he could be made
commissary of the order at Madrid. In any case he was sure to be taken
care of to the end of his days.</p>
<p>As for the Orders in themselves, I have already said that, excepting
the Society of Jesus, they are little republics, and that
office-holders are elected by the votes of the members. When a general
Chapter of the Order is held for this purpose, the members come from
all parts and assemble in their convent in Manila.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that there has sometimes been so much feeling
aroused over the question of the distribution of the loaves and fishes,
that the opposing parties have broken up the chairs and benches to
serve as clubs, and furiously attacked each other in the battle royal,
and with deplorable results.</p>
<p>In consequence of this, when the chapter or general assembly was to
be held, the governor-general nominated a royal commissary, often a
colonel in the army, to be present at these meetings, but only to
interfere to keep the peace. It was something of an anomaly to see a
son of Mars deputed to keep the peace in an assembly of the clergy. The
meeting commenced with prayer, then one by one all the dignitaries laid
down their offices and became private members of the Order, so that at
the end of this ceremony every one was absolutely equal.</p>
<p>Then the eldest rose and solemnly adjured any one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>present
who held a Bull of the Holy Father, to produce it then and there under
pain of major excommunication. Three times was this solemn warning
delivered.</p>
<p>It owes its origin, perhaps, to some surprise sprung on a
brotherhood in former days, yet it is to be noted that one of the
privileges of their Catholic majesties the kings of Spain was, that no
Bull should run in their dominions without their approval.</p>
<p>Then free from outside interference, and all present being on an
equal footing the election takes place. Amidst great excitement the
Provincial, the Procurator, the Orator, the Definidores, or
Councillors, are chosen according to their popularity, or as they are
deemed best fitted to advance the interests of the voter or the
Order.</p>
<p>The selection of office-holders is a matter of the greatest
importance to the members, as those in power distribute the benefices
and are apt to be more alive to the merits of their supporters, than to
the pretensions of those who have voted for others.</p>
<p>But, however divided they may be on these occasions, they unite
against any outsider, and unless the question is evidently personal, he
who offends a member finds the Order ranged against him, and, perhaps,
the other Orders also, for in matters affecting their interests the
Orders act in unison, and as has been said, have succeeded in removing
not only governors of provinces, but governors-general also when these
have failed to do their bidding. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Augustinians own some fine estates near Manila. In
1877 I visited Malinta and Piedad, which, according to an old plan
exhibited to me, drawn by some ancient navigator, measured over 14,000
acres in extent, a good part of which was cultivated and under paddy;
still a large expanse was rocky, and grew only cogon (elephant grass).
The lay-brother in charge, Aureliano Garcia, confided to me that he
went about in fear, and expected to end his life under the bolos of the
tenants. I was then new to the country, and saw no signs of discontent.
I afterwards visited Mandaloyan, another estate nearer Manila. This was
nearly all arable land. The house was large and commodious, and was
used as a convalescent home for the friars. I have not a note of the
extent of this estate, but it occupies a great part of the space
between the rivers Maibonga and San Juan, to the north of the Pasig.
The lay-brother in charge, Julian Ibeas, did not seem at all anxious
about his safety. The land here was more fertile than that of Malinta,
and there was water carriage to a market for the crops.</p>
<p>In view of my report, which was not, however, unduly optimistic, my
clients deputed me to ask the Augustinians for a lease of the above
three estates for twenty-five years, the rent to be $40,000<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e3886src" href="#xd20e3886" name="xd20e3886src">1</a>
per year for three years, and each year after that an addition of a
thousand dollars, so that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>the ultimate rent would be $62,000
per annum. However, after taking some time to consider, the procurator
declined the offer.</p>
<p>On the above estates there was little or nothing done by the owners
to improve the land. They had limited themselves to building large and
convenient houses and granaries for their own accommodation, and to
entertain their friends.</p>
<p>In 1884 I constructed a pumping station on the River Tuliajan in
this estate, and laid a pipe line right through the property to supply
fresh water to the sugar refinery at Malabon, five miles distant. I had
no difficulty in obtaining permission, indeed, Fray Arsenio Campo (now
Bishop of Nueva C&aacute;ceres) facilitated the work in every way. The
only protest was by Doroteo Cortes, a half-caste lawyer, who interposed
as the pipe had to pass between two fish-ponds belonging to him, and he
extorted a blackmail $800 to withdraw his opposition. Let the reader
contrast the behaviour of the Spaniard and the half-caste, now posing
as an &ldquo;Americanista.&rdquo;</p>
<p>San Francisco de Malabon, another possession of theirs, is a
magnificent property, situated on the fertile, well-watered land that
slopes from the summits of the Tagaytay range, north of the vast
crater-lake of Bombon, to the shores of the ever-famous Bay of Bacoor,
the scene of Spain&rsquo;s naval collapse.</p>
<p>Through the volcanic soil three rivers, the Ilang-ilang, the
Camanch&iacute;le, and the J&aacute;lan, have cut deep gashes down to
the bed-rock, on the surface of which the rapid waters rush downwards
to the sea.</p>
<p>A nobly-proportioned house of stone, almost a fortress, was planted
where it commanded a grand, a stately view. From its windows the
spectator looked over fields of waving grain, over fruit trees, and
town and hamlets, down to the sea shore, and across the vast expanse of
placid bay to where in the far north solitary Arayat rears his head.
The thick walls and lofty roof excluded the solar heat, and the
green-painted Venetians saved the inmate from the glare. Very welcome
was that hostel, furnished in severe ecclesiastical almost
medi&aelig;val style, to me, after the dusty up-hill drive of eight
miles from Cavite.</p>
<p>I visited this estate in 1879, and found that extensive irrigation
works had been carried out. A new dam on one of the rivers, about fifty
feet high, was approaching completion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>Unfortunately, the work
had been executed by a lay-brother, a stone mason, without professional
supervision. He was ignorant of the necessity of taking special
precautions when preparing the seat for the dam. Although he had a bed
of volcanic tuff to build upon he would not go to the trouble to cut
into and stop all faults and crevices in the rock before laying his
first course of masonry, and he hurried on the job to save expense as
he supposed. For the same reason he did not attempt to follow the
correct profile of the dam. When the pressure came on, the water
spouted up in little fountains, and gradually increased as it cut away
the soft stone. I advised them what to do, and after a good deal of
work, Portland cement and puddled clay got them out of their
difficulty.</p>
<p>About four miles to the eastward of San Francisco de Malabon, and on
the same volcanic soil, is the great estate of Imus belonging to the
Recollets, or unshod Augustinians. It is about five miles from the
landing-place at Bacoor. Here again three rivers run through the
property, and the view from the house is the same.</p>
<p>The house itself was a grim fortress and served the rebels well in
1896, for they found arms and ammunition in it, and successfully
defended it against General Aiguirre who had to retire, being unable to
take it without artillery.</p>
<p>In 1897 the army of General Lachambre advanced against Imus, and on
the 24th March took the outer defences of the town, notwithstanding the
determined resistance of the Tagals, of whom three hundred were killed
in a hand-to-hand combat. Next day the estate house, which adjoins the
town and had been for six months the stronghold of the Katipunan, was
bombarded and burnt, only the ruins remain.</p>
<p>There are extensive works of irrigation at this place also, and
formerly a large sugar works was built here by the owners, but it
failed, as there was no one fit to take charge of it.</p>
<p>I have not visited this Hacienda, and cannot give its extent or
value.</p>
<p>Of all the Orders the greatest land-owners are the Dominicans. They
have vast estates in Calamba, Cabuy&aacute;o, Santa Rosa, Bi&ntilde;an,
and San Pedro Tunas&aacute;n, all on the Lake of Bay, also at Naic and
Santa Cruz on the Bay of Manila. I have several times visited their
estates at the first two places, and can affirm that they have expended
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>considerable sums in building dams for irrigating
the lands, and I supplied them with some very large cast-iron pipes for
the purpose of making a syphon across a ravine or narrow valley to
convey water for irrigating the opposite plain. They have consequently
very largely increased the value of these lands.</p>
<p>The house at Calamba, solidly built of stone, with a strong and high
encircling wall, served as a fortified camp and headquarters for the
Spanish army in operation against the rebels in 1897.</p>
<p>This estate of Calamba has earned a sad notoriety in the
Philippines, for the disputes which constantly arose between the
administration and their tenants.</p>
<p>It is hardly too much to say that the possession of estates has been
fatal to the Orders. They claim to have always been good and indulgent
landlords, but the fact remains that all these estates are in Tagal
territory, that only the Tagals revolted, and that the revolt was
directed against the Orders because of their tyranny and extortions,
and because they were landlords and rack renters.</p>
<p>It was, is now, and ever will be an Agrarian question that will
continue to give trouble and be the cause of crime and outrage until
settled in a broad-minded and statesman-like manner.</p>
<p>These estates have been a bone of contention for centuries, and were
a principal cause of the last revolt of the Tagals. Yet the Peace
Commission at Paris appears to have given the three Orders a new title
to their disputed possessions by guaranteeing to the Church the
enjoyment of its property, which, if the Spaniards had continued to
rule the islands, must ultimately have been taken from it in the
natural course of events, as has happened in every other Catholic
country.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the pacification of the Philippines by the
American forces has been greatly retarded, and is now rendered more
difficult, by this clause, which must have been accepted by the
American commissioners under a misapprehension of its import, and from
imperfect information as to the <i>status quo</i>. This difficult
matter can still be arranged, but it will require the outlay of a
considerable sum of money, which, however, would eventually be
recouped.</p>

<p>In present circumstances I venture to say that a garrison would be
needed at each estate to protect an administrator <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>or
collector, for the Tagal tenants are as averse to paying rent for land
as any bog-trotter in Tipperary. I do not envy anybody who purchases
these estates, nor would I consider the life of such a one a good risk
for an insurance company, if he intended to press the tenants for rents
or arrears.</p>
<p>To sum up the Religious Orders, they were hardy and adventurous
pioneers of Christianity, and in the evangelisation of the Philippines,
by persuasion and teaching, they did more for Christianity and
civilisation than any other missionaries of modern times.</p>
<p>Of undaunted courage they have ever been to the front when
calamities threatened their flocks; they have witnessed and recorded
some of the most dreadful convulsions of nature, volcanic eruptions,
earthquakes, and destructive typhoons. In epidemics of plague and
cholera they have not been dismayed, nor have they ever in such cases
abandoned their flocks.</p>
<p>When an enemy has attacked the islands they have been the first to
face the shot. Only fervent faith could enable these men to endure the
hardships, and overcome the dangers that encompassed them.</p>
<p>They have done much for education, having founded schools for both
sexes, training colleges for teachers, the university of St. Thomas in
Manila, and other institutions.</p>
<p>Hospitals and asylums attest their charity. They were formerly, and
even lately, the protectors of the poor against the rich, and of the
native against the Spaniard. They have consistently resisted the
enslavement of the natives.</p>
<p>They restrained the constant inclination of the natives to wander
away into the woods and return to primitive savagery by keeping them in
the towns, or, as they said, &ldquo;Under the bells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, peace and plenty (those blessings for which we
pray), have corrupted and demoralised the Orders. No longer liable at
any moment to be called upon to fight for their lives, the sterner
virtues have decayed. Increased production and export enriched the
people, a gold coinage was introduced, and the friars allowed avarice
to possess their souls.</p>
<p>In those lands of perpetual summer no death duties have to be paid
to a Chancellor of the Exchequer, as in this island of fog and
mist.</p>
<p>But the friars have a system of charges for performing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>the
funeral ceremonies, which comes to much the same in the end. I call it
a system; it is a very simple system, and consists in extorting as much
as they can get, taking into consideration the wealth of the family. To
give an instance, I have been assured by a son of Capitan Natalio
Lopez, of Balayan, a native gentleman well known to me, that the parish
priest charged the family six hundred dollars for performing their
father&rsquo;s funeral ceremony. The same rule applies to baptisms and
marriages, and this abuse calls for redress, and for the establishment
of fixed fees according to the position of the parties.</p>
<p>Each friar, as a parish priest, was an outpost of the central
government, watching for symptoms of revolt. Only thus could the
Spaniards hold the archipelago with fifteen hundred Peninsular troops,
and a small squadron of warships.</p>
<p>The greatest, and the best-founded, complaint of the natives against
the priests, was that whoever displeased them, either in personal or
money matters, was liable to be denounced to the authorities as a
filibuster, and to be torn from home and family and deported to some
distant and probably unhealthy spot, there to reside, at his own cost,
for an indefinite time, by arbitrary authority, without process of law.
Such a punishment, euphoniously termed &ldquo;forced residence,&rdquo;
sometimes involved the death of the exile, and always caused heavy
expense, as a pardon could not be obtained without bribing some
one.</p>
<p>Ysabelo de los Reyes, and other natives, accuse the friars of
extorting evidence from suspected persons by torture. I fear there can
be no doubt that many victims, including a number of the native
clerics, suffered flagellation and other tortures at the hands of the
friars for the above purpose. The convents of Nueva-C&aacute;ceres and
of Vigan, amongst other places, were the scenes of these abominable
practices, and Augustinians, Dominicans and Franciscans, have taken
part in them. This is referred to at greater length in another part of
this work under the heading, &ldquo;The Insurrection of
1896.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Individual friars were sometimes, nay, often, very worthy parish
priests. I have known many such. But a community is often worse than
the individuals of which it is composed. One might say with the Italian
musician who had served for many years in a cathedral, and had obtained
the promise of every individual canon to support <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>his
application for a pension, when he was told that the chapter had
unanimously refused his request:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The canons are good, but the chapter is bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A board will jointly do a meaner action than the shadiest director
amongst them, and should it comprise one or two members of obtrusive
piety, that circumstance enables it to disregard the ordinary standard
of right and wrong with more assurance.</p>
<p>There is a law in metallurgy which has a curious analogy to this law
of human nature. It is this: An alloy composed of several metals of
different melting-points, will fuse at a lower temperature than that of
its lowest fusing constituent.</p>
<p>The Orders, then, have been of the greatest service in the past;
they have brought the Philippines and their inhabitants to a certain
pitch of civilisation, and credit is due to them for this much, even if
they could go no farther. For years their influence over the natives
has been decreasing, and year by year the natives have become more and
more antagonistic to priestly rule.</p>
<p>A considerable intellectual development has taken place of late
years in the Philippines. The natives are no longer content to continue
upon the old lines; they aspire to a freer life. Many even harbour a
sentiment of nationality such as was never thought of before.</p>
<p>But if the Orders had lost ground with the natives and with many
Spaniards, their influence still preponderated. Owners of vast estates,
possessors of fabulous riches, armed with spiritual authority, knowing
the secrets of every family, holding the venal courts of justice as in
the hollow of their hand, dominating the local government, standing
above the law, and purchasing the downfall of their enemies from the
corrupt ministries in Madrid, these giant trusts, jealous of each
other, yet standing firmly shoulder to shoulder in the common cause,
constitute a barrier to progress that can have no place nor use under
an American Protectorate. They are an anachronism in the twentieth
century, and they must disappear as corporations from the
Philippines.</p>
<p>They should not, however, be buried under an avalanche of contumely
and slander; their long and glorious past should be remembered, and in
winding up their estates due regard should be paid to the interests of
every member. I cannot here intimate how this is to be done, for it is
an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>intricate subject, rendered more complex by the
reluctance of the American Government to interfere in religious
matters, even though they are so bound up with the politics of the
Philippines that no pacification can be effected without following
popular sentiment upon this point.</p>
<p>So far as the landed estates are concerned, the settlement could be
arrived at by a commission with ample powers. In the meantime, no sale
of these estates should be recognised.</p>
<p>The benefices held by the friars should be gradually bestowed upon
the secular clergy, as suitable men can be found. The native clergy
have always been badly used by the friars; they have had to suffer
abuse and ignominious treatment. They have not been in a position to
develop their dignity and self-respect.</p>
<p>I have spoken of them in general as leaving something to be desired
as to decorous conduct, but they will doubtless improve when placed in
positions of consideration and responsibility.</p>
<p>Amongst them are men of considerable learning; some have passed
brilliant examinations in theology and canon law.</p>
<p>As regards piety, Malays, whether heathen, Mahometan or Christian,
take their religion lightly, and we must not expect too much. I daresay
they are pious enough for the country and the climate. <span class=

Filipina</span>&rdquo;&mdash;The Katipunan&mdash;Its programme.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fray Eduardo Navarro, Procurator of the Augustinians,
and Ysabelo de los Reyes, an Ilocano, and author of some notable works,
agree that the first masonic lodge of the Philippines was founded in
Cavite about 1860. The latter states that Malcampo and
Mendez-Nu&ntilde;ez, two distinguished naval officers, were the
founders. Soon after this, another lodge was founded in Zamboanga, also
under naval auspices. After 1868, a lodge was founded in Manila by
foreigners, a wealthy Filipino being secretary. Another lodge was
founded in Pandakan, another in Ceb&uacute;, and still another in
Cavite, to which Crisanto Reyes and Maximo Inocencio belonged.</p>
<p>These lodges at first had only Peninsular Spaniards or other
Europeans as members, but gradually Creoles, Mestizos, and natives,
joined the brotherhood, and subscribed liberally to its funds.</p>
<p>The Catholic clergy have always looked upon Masons as most dangerous
enemies, and many pontiffs have launched their anathemas against the
brotherhood. But, so far as one can see, to quote from &lsquo;The
Jackdaw of Rheims,&rsquo; &ldquo;No one seemed a penny the
worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Masonry grows and flourishes in spite of them all. To give an
example. Many years ago, in the very Catholic city of Lima, I attended
the civil funeral of a priest, the learned Doctor Don Francisco de
Paula Gonzales Vigil, who died excommunicate. Twelve thousand men,
including the Masons with their insignia, deputations from the Senate
and Chamber, from the Municipality, Army, Navy, and other bodies,
formed the funeral <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>. The Municipality <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>presented a tomb in the public cemetery, which is
one of the finest in the world, and an orator pronounced an impassioned
eulogy upon the virtues and patriotism of the deceased. It was a
wonderful manifestation, and remains graven upon my memory. On that day
every priest and friar found something to occupy himself with at home.
Whatever may be the case in Great Britain or in the United States,
there can be no doubt that in Catholic countries the lodges are
antagonistic to the clergy and the Church.</p>
<p>The lodges in the Philippines were founded by anti-clerical
Spaniards of liberal views, and the Creoles, Mestizos and natives who
joined them found brethren disposed to sympathise with them and to work
with them against the friars. There was no idea of revolting against
the mother country, but rather to introduce a more liberal government,
with representation for the civilised provinces in the Spanish
C&oacute;rtes. It must be remembered that this representation had
already existed, and only required to be revived. There had been
deputies to the C&oacute;rtes-Generales from 1810 to 1814, and from
1820 to 1823, and Procuradores from 1834 to 1837.</p>
<p>The C&oacute;rtes of Cadiz, on 14th October, 1810,
declared:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The kingdoms and provinces of America and Asia
are, and ought to have been always, reputed an integral part of the
Spanish monarchy, and for that same, their natives and free inhabitants
<i>are equal in rights and privileges to those of the
peninsula</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>These are very noble words, and, delivered in the majestic language
of Castile by some enthusiastic orator, must have gone straight to the
hearts of those that heard them.</p>
<p>Spain is as celebrated for orators as Great Britain for the lack of
them. Our generation has never produced a speaker like Castelar. But,
unfortunately for the Philippines, these grand and sonorous phrases
dissolved in air, and led to nothing practical. The friars stoutly
opposed what to them seemed dangerous innovations; they were
successful, and darkness again prevailed.</p>
<p>The insurrection of Cavite, in 1872, resulted in the execution or
exile of many members of the masonic body, and the brotherhood was for
some years under a cloud.</p>
<p>The Peninsular Spaniards dissociated themselves from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>the
revolutionary party. To use a simile which has been employed in England
to describe the difference between Liberals and Radicals, they were
&ldquo;going by the same train, but not going so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Creoles and Mestizos gradually founded new societies, which were
alleged to aim at obtaining reforms by legal and constitutional
means.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Asociacion Hispano-Filipina&rdquo; had for its first
president Doroteo Cort&eacute;s, and amongst its officers Ambrosio
Rianzares Bautista, Pedro Serrano, and Deodato Arellano.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Liga Filipina&rdquo; was founded by Dr. Rizal and Domingo
Franco; its first president was shot. Nearly all the members were
Masons; they were well off, and of fair education, not inclined to put
their persons or property in danger. They did not want to fight. Their
programme may be summed up as follows:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Expulsion of the friars, and confiscation of their estates.</li>
<li>2. The same political, administrative and economical concessions as
had been granted to Cuba. Freedom of the press, and freedom of
association.</li>
<li>3. Equalisation of the Philippine and Peninsular armies, and a just
division of Civil Service posts between natives and Spaniards.</li>
<li>4. Return to owners of lands usurped by the friars, and sale of
such lands as really belonged to the Orders.</li>
<li>5. Prevention of insults to the Philippine natives, either in
sermons or in the press.</li>
<li>6. Economy in expenditure. Reduction of imposts. Construction of
railways and public works.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was certainly not without risk to be a member of one of these
societies, for the Orders are vindictive in the extreme, and are not
troubled with scruples when it is a question of punishing an
opponent.</p>
<p>Still, the Creole and Mestizo element were made cautious by the
possession of property, and its members cannot be called fighting-men.
They did not intend to run the risk of having holes bored through
them.</p>
<p>They founded newspapers in Spain; they wrote violent articles, they
made speeches, they obtained the support of some Liberals and
anti-clericals in the Peninsula, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>numbered many adherents
in the islands. Still, they were comparatively harmless. Not so,
however, was a society which was formed of very different elements.
Taking a hint, perhaps, from the murderous brotherhood of the
Ku-Klux-Klan, some resolute and courageous Tagals imagined and formed
that terrible secret society, the Katipunan. There is no K in the
Spanish alphabet, but this letter is found in the Malay dialects, and
consequently in Tagal. Therefore, the symbol of the society, K.K.K.,
was as distinctly anti-Spanish as was the full title, which was
represented by the initials&mdash;</p>
<p class="xd20e120">N M A N B</p>
<p>The words corresponding to these initials were:&mdash;</p>

<p>The members of the Katipunan were poor people&mdash;writers, common
soldiers, washermen, mechanics, and tenants on the friars&rsquo;
estates. They subscribed small sums monthly for the purchase of arms,
and for other expenses. Bearing in mind how many conspiracies had been
denounced to the priests by the women, the leaders of this movement
gave their meetings the outward appearance of benevolent associations,
and directed the members to represent the society to their wives in
that light.</p>
<p>Later on a woman&rsquo;s lodge, with twenty-five members was
organised, under the presidency of Marina Dison, but the women were not
informed of the true object of the society.</p>
<p>Fray Eduardo Navarro, Procurator of the Augustinians, in a
cleverly-written work, entitled &lsquo;The Philippines; a Study of
Certain Matters of Moment,&rsquo; published in 1897, prints under No. 3
of the Appendix the title granted by the Walana Lodge, No. 158,
certifying that &ldquo;our dear sister, Purificacion Leyva, has been
initiated in the degree of Companion-Mason at the session of 8th April,
1894.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On reading this work, I infer that the friars considered the
Katipunan a Masonic body, but this is a mistake. The Katipunan adopted
some of the Masonic paraphernalia, and some of the initiatory
ceremonies, but were in no sense Masonic lodges.</p>
<p>The programme of the Katipunan was, in its own words, &ldquo;to
redeem the Philippines from its tyrants, the friars, and to found a
communistic republic.&rdquo; This was simple and direct, and they meant
it.</p>
<p>How many men were affiliated to this society cannot be known.
Estimates range from 10,000 to 50,000 members. I think there can be no
doubt that it was the most potent factor in the insurrection of 1896,
and that its members, unlike the Creoles and Mestizos, were ready to
give their lives for their cause. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Augustinians take credit to themselves that one of
their order, Father Mariano Gil, parish priest of Tondo, discovered the
existence of the revolutionary conspiracy, on the 19th August. But
already on the 5th of July a lieutenant of the Guardia Civil had
declared in a written report that there were over 14,000 men belonging
to the valley of the Pasig, affiliated to the conspiracy.</p>
<p>A council of the authorities was convened on the 6th of August, but
nothing was done. On that same date, however, the Governor of Batangas
telegraphed that a discovery of arms, ammunition and Republican flags
had been made at Taal. In consequence of this, General Blanco ordered
some arrests to be made.</p>
<p>On the 19th, Father Gil gave information to General Blanco that he
had discovered the existence of a secret revolutionary society, and two
days later Blanco reported to the Government in Madrid that there
existed a vast organization of secret societies.</p>
<p>At this time the garrison of Manila consisted of some 1500 men, most
of them being natives. As arrests were being continually made, the
members of the Katipunan, or those suspected of being such, left their
homes and took to the woods although very poorly equipped with
fire-arms.</p>
<p>On 30th August a party of the rebels under Sancho <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>Valenzuela, Modesto Sarmiento, and others had a
fight with some native cavalry and Guardias Civiles at San Juan del
Monte near Manila. The rebels lost heavily in killed, their chiefs were
taken prisoners and shot on the 4th September, at the Paseo de la
Luneta.</p>
<p>A Spanish artilleryman was murdered by some rebels at Pandacan about
this time, and martial law was proclaimed.</p>
<p>The Guardia Civil, all native soldiers, was now concentrated in
Manila abandoning their outlying posts. After many vacillations and
contradictory cablegrams to the Government in Madrid, General Blanco
now definitely asked for large reinforcements.</p>
<p>On September 1st, the people of Noveleta revolted and killed a
captain and a lieutenant of the Guardia Civil and three days later the
rebels penetrated to the town of Caridad, close to Cavite.</p>
<p>Early in September rebels were in arms, and dominating great part of
the Provinces of Manila, Cavite, Batangas, Bulacan, Pampanga and Nueva
&Eacute;cija.</p>
<p>By the middle of the month rebel bands appeared in Tarlac,
Pangasin&aacute;n, Laguna, Morong and Tayabas.</p>
<p>On the 9th September, the Cavite rebels attacked San Roque, which is
close to the town of Cavite, and burned part of it. On the 12th,
thirteen persons who had been convicted by a court-martial of
complicity in the revolt were shot in Cavite.</p>
<p>The cables from General Blanco to the Madrid Government were all
this time misleading and contradictory, and showed that he had no grasp
of the state of affairs. These dispatches were subjected to severe
criticism in the <i>Heraldo</i>, a Madrid newspaper.</p>
<p>By the middle of September troops arrived from Zamboanga and other
southern stations, and the garrison of Manila was brought up to 6000
men, two-thirds of whom were natives. Reinforcements were sent to
Cavite, for the rebels were in great force about Silang, Imus, and
Noveleta.</p>
<p>On the 17th September another attack was made by the rebels on San
Roque, but was repulsed.</p>
<p>On the 1st October the mail steamer <i>Catalu&ntilde;a</i> arrived
with a battalion of marines from Spain, greatly to the delight of the
Spaniards, who gave the force an enthusiastic reception. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>Next day the ss. <i>Monserrat</i> arrived with more troops, and from
this time forward troops kept pouring in.</p>
<p>Still General Blanco remained on the defensive in and around the
city of Manila and the town of Cavite, and repulsed attacks made by the
rebels on the magazines at Binanc&aacute;yan and Las Pi&ntilde;as.</p>
<p>The rebels were now firmly established over the rest of the Province
of Cavite. The natural features of this part of Luzon made the
movements of regular troops extremely difficult. The country abounds in
rivers which run from south to north parallel to each other at short
distances. They run at the bottom of deep ravines, which present
excellent positions for defence. Many of these rivers have dams across
them and the sluices in these might be opened by the defenders, or the
dams could be blown up in case a column of the assailants should be
entangled in the ravine below, when they would inevitably be
overwhelmed in the descending torrent.</p>
<p>In places the country could be flooded and thus be rendered
impassable for troops.</p>
<p>But the industry of the rebels, skilfully directed, had added
enormously to these natural advantages. From the reports of
eye-witnesses I can affirm that the entrenchments of the Tagals were
colossal. Tagals and Boers have demonstrated that a competitive
examination is not necessary to enable fighting-men to entrench
themselves. The Tagal lines ran from the delta of the Zapote River to
Naic in an almost unbroken line, approximately parallel to the
coast.</p>
<p>They were doubled and trebled in front of villages or towns and
across the roads.</p>
<p>The trace was <i>en cr&eacute;maill&egrave;re</i>, the section being
6 feet thick at the top and 8 feet high, the exterior face vertical,
with a revetment of bamboos fastened together with rattans. It was in
fact a bank of earth built up against a strong bamboo fence.</p>
<p>The defenders fired through loop-holes left in the parapet, and were
very well covered, but they could only fire straight before them and
horizontally.</p>
<p>The defences of the towns had thicker and loftier parapets; in some
cases there were three tiers of loop-holes properly splayed.</p>
<p>The insurgents were very insufficiently armed, and at first there
were ten men to a rifle. The man who was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>reputed the best shot
carried the rifle and cartridge belt, and if he was killed or wounded
in an engagement, the next best shot took the weapon and continued the
fight. In the early actions there was scarcely ever a rifle left on the
ground by the insurgents.</p>
<p>The only cannon the rebels had at first were some ancient brass
swivel guns called falconetes or lant&aacute;cas, which they took from
the estate-houses at Imus and Malabon.</p>
<p>They also had some brass mortars like quart pots, which are used for
firing salutes on feast days. These they fastened at an angle to blocks
of wood, thus making small howitzers, quite effective at short range.
They loaded these with the punchings from boiler-plates and broken
cooking-pots.</p>
<p>They showed a considerable ingenuity in making cannon out of any
materials at hand. They would take a steel boiler-tube, a stay tube for
choice, say about three inches bore and a quarter of an inch thick.
Plugging up one end and drilling a touch-hole, they would drive this
tube into a hole bored in a log of hard wood turned on the outside to a
taper, then they drove eight or nine wrought-iron rings over the wood.
They drilled through the wood to suit the touch-hole and the gun was
ready.</p>
<p>They fitted no trunnions, but mounted this rude cannon upon a solid
block of wood.</p>
<p>In other cases they made some wire guns by lapping steel
boiler-tubes with telegraph-wire.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the campaign of Lachambre&rsquo;s division
against the rebels, some modern field-pieces of eight
centim&egrave;tres were captured from them, but it is not clear where
these came from.</p>
<p>To supplement their scanty stock of rifles, they made some hand-guns
of gas-tube. These were fired by applying a match or lighted cigar to
the touch-hole, and would seem to be very clumsy weapons. But I may say
that when on a visit to the estate of Palpa, in Peru, I saw a Chinaman
who was in charge of the poultry corral, kill a hawk hovering, with a
similar gun.</p>
<p>The Spanish Military and Naval Authorities now took the revolt very
seriously, and on the 8th November the squadron comprising the
<i>Castilla</i>, <i>Reina Cristina</i>, and other vessels, and the guns
of the forts at Cavite and Puerto Vaga, opened upon the rebel position
at Cavite, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>Viejo, Noveleta, Binanc&aacute;yan, and other
places within range, and kept it up for hours. The next morning the
firing was resumed at daylight, supplemented by the guns from launches
and boats well inshore. Troops were landed under the protection of the
squadron, and advanced against the entrenchments of Binanc&aacute;yan.
They delivered three frontal attacks with great gallantry, reaching the
parapet each time, but were beaten back, leaving many dead upon the
ground. No flanking attack was possible here for the parapet extended
for many miles each way.</p>
<p>A simultaneous attack was made upon Noveleta by a column of 3000
Spanish and native infantry under Colonel Fermin Diaz Mattoni.</p>
<p>This force started from Cavite and marched through Dalahican and
along the road to Noveleta. This road is a raised causeway running
through a mangrove swamp, having deep mud on each side impassable for
troops. This is at least a mile of swamp, and the troops advanced along
the causeway and crossed a bridge which spanned a muddy creek.</p>
<p>No enemy was in sight, and the town was not far off. Suddenly the
head of the column fell into a most cunningly devised pitfall. The road
had been dug out, the pit covered with wattle, and the surface restored
to its original appearance. The bottom of the pit was set with pointed
bamboo stakes which inflicted serious wounds upon those that fell upon
them.</p>
<p>At the moment of confusion the rebels opened a withering fire from
concealed positions amongst the mangroves upon the column standing in
the open.</p>
<p>The Spaniards and native troops made great efforts to get forward,
but could not stand the fire and had to retire. When they got back to
the bridge it was down, and they had to wade across the creek under a
close fire from the rebels hidden amongst the mangroves. In this action
the Spaniards are said to have lost 600 killed and many hundreds
wounded. The loss fell principally on the 73rd and 74th Regiments of
Native Infantry.</p>
<p>The rebels were greatly encouraged, and got possession of a large
number of rifles, with ammunition and accoutrements.</p>
<p>Both these attacks were made under the direction of General Blanco,
who witnessed them from a lofty staging erected within the lines of
<span class="corr" id="xd20e4358" title=
"Source: Dalah&iacute;can">Dalahican</span>. After these disasters
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>he resumed the defensive, except that the squadron
and the batteries at Cavite and Puerto Vaga frequently bombarded the
rebel positions.</p>
<p>At this time thousands of natives were in prison in Manila awaiting
their trial. A permanent court-martial had been organised to try the
suspects. Great numbers were shot, and many hundreds were transported
to the Caroline Islands, to Ceuta, and Fernando P&oacute;. Wealthy
natives were mercilessly blackmailed, and it is reported that those who
were discharged had to pay large sums for their release.</p>
<p>The Spanish Volunteers in Manila committed many arbitrary and even
outrageous actions, and aroused the hatred of the natives far more than
the regular troops did. They allowed their patriotism to carry them
into most lamentable excesses.</p>
<p>On the 25th February a rising and mutiny of the Carbineers or
Custom-House Guards took place in Manila at the captain of the
port&rsquo;s office. The scheme miscarried and was only partially
successful. The officer on duty was shot, and also the sergeant, and
the rebels made off with some rifles and ammunition.</p>
<p>The volunteers and some troops hastily called together pursued the
rebels through Tondo as far as the Leper Hospital, till nightfall, the
last volley being fired at 6.15 P.M. In this affair the mutineers lost
a great many men, but some of them got away and joined the rebels.</p>
<p>Blanco had not been severe enough with the rebels or suspected
rebels to please the friars. His management of the attacks upon
Noveleta and Binanc&aacute;yan had been faulty, and his health was bad.
It was not surprising<a id="xd20e4374" name="xd20e4374"></a>, having
the priests against him, and the military dissatisfied, that he was
recalled. He left at the end of 1896. General Polavieja, an officer who
had risen from the ranks by his military talents, and who, when serving
in Cuba, had very accurately gauged the situation, and had made a
remarkably clever report to the government, was sent out to replace
Blanco. Polavieja was inexorable with the rebels and their
sympathisers. Military executions took place about once a week for two
months. Francisco Roxas, a mestizo ship-owner, Numeriano Adriano, and
many other mestizos and natives were shot at the Paseo de la
Luneta.</p>
<p>On December 6th the prisoners in Cavite jail rose, murdered their
jailer, and attempted to escape. One <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>hundred and fifty
prisoners were concerned in this affair. Of these, forty-seven were
shot in the streets of the town, and twenty-one were captured, whilst
thirteen were shot in the bushes behind Ca&ntilde;acao. Those
recaptured were tried for prison-breaking, and were all shot the next
morning.</p>
<p>By the beginning of 1897, a large number of troops had arrived from
Spain. They were, however, largely conscripts, raw youths who had never
handled a rifle, mere raw material in fact, sent out without uniform or
equipment, many having only what they stood up in, or at most, having a
spare shirt and a singlet tied up in a handkerchief. We talk about the
shortcomings of our War Office officials, and certainly they sometimes
give examples of wooden-headed stupidity, and are behind the age in
many particulars. But for deliberate inhumanity, for utter callousness
to human suffering, to loss of health and life, I think the Spanish War
Office could hardly be outdone. And I speak of their misdeeds from
personal knowledge in the Philippines and in Cuba. What an enormous
amount of suffering was caused to the working-people of Spain by the
sending to Cuba and to the Philippines of over 200,000 men in
1895&ndash;96. Never in this generation were men shipped away so
destitute of clothing, provisions, surgeons and medical comforts. Never
have I seen troops in the field with such wretched equipment, or so
devoid of transport, tents, and supplies.</p>
<p>Whatever successes they achieved were secured by the inborn valour
of the troops, and by extraordinary exertions on the part of the
generals and staff to improvise on the spot what the national treasury
should have supplied them with at the commencement of hostilities.</p>
<p>The raw recruits having been drilled and exercised with the rifle
were organised in fifteen battalions and called Cazadores (chasseurs).
These battalions, with four regiments of native infantry and some
native volunteers, were formed into brigades under Generals Cornell,
Marina, Jaramillo and Galbis. The first three brigades constituted a
division, which was placed under the command of General Lachambre, an
officer of great energy, and of long experience in the Cuban wars.</p>
<p>By the beginning of 1897 the Tagal rebellion had concentrated its
forces in the province of Cavite. Embers of rebellion still smouldered
in other provinces of Luzon, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>but many rebels from outlying places
had thrown in their lot with those of Cavite, and in great numbers,
very indifferently supplied with arms and ammunition, but amply with
provisions, they confidently awaited the long-prepared attack of the
Spanish forces behind the formidable entrenchments that their
persevering labour had raised. In the interval they had organised
themselves after a fashion, and had instituted a reign of terror
wherever they held sway.</p>
<p>The organisation of the rebels in the province of Cavite was of a
somewhat confused nature, and seemed to respond to the ambition and
influence of particular individuals rather than to any systematic
principle.</p>
<p>Thus Silang was declared a vice-royalty under Victor Belarmino,
styled Victor I.</p>
<p>The rest of the province was divided into two districts, each ruled
by a council; the first was Imus and its vicinity, under Bernardino
Aguinaldo with ministers of war, of the treasury, of agriculture and of
justice.</p>
<p>The second was San Francisco de Malabon, presided over by Mariano
Alvarez, with ministers of state as above.</p>
<p>But above the kingdom of Silang and the two republics, the President
of the Katipunan, Andres Bonifacio, held sway as lieutenant of the
Generalissimo Emilio Aguinaldo. He resided in his palace at San
Francisco, and from there dictated his orders. The supreme power was in
the hands of Aguinaldo.</p>
<p>All these authorities exercised despotic power, and certainly
ill-treated and robbed their own countrymen who did not desire to join
them, far more than the Spaniards have ever done in the worst of times.
They frequently inflicted the death-penalty, and their so-called
courts-martial no more thought of acquitting an accused person than a
regimental court-martial in England would. The terrible President of
the Katipunan ultimately became a victim of one of these blood-thirsty
tribunals.</p>
<p>Their military organization was curious. The province was
sub-divided into military zones. First Silang, second Imus, third
Bacoor, fourth San Francisco de Malabon, fifth Alfonso. Each zone had
an army which consisted of all the population able to work, and was
divided into two parts, the active or fighting force and the auxiliary
but non-combatant part. The active force was divided into regiments and
companies, and these last into riflemen and spearmen, there being
commonly five of the latter to one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92"
href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>of the former. Besides the usual
military ranks, they instituted the following functionaries:</p>

<p>The rebels occupied the whole of the province of Cavite, except the
fortified town of that name containing the naval arsenal, and a small
strip on the shores of the Laguna where the Spanish troops were
posted.</p>
<p>Cornell&rsquo;s brigade was at Calamba and Marina&rsquo;s brigade at
Bi&ntilde;an. They had outlying detachments amounting to 1500 men at
Santa Cruz, Santo Domingo, Tayabas, and along the line from
Tan&aacute;uan to Ba&ntilde;adero, leaving each brigade 4000 men for
the advance into the rebel territory. The divisional troops numbered
about 1300, making a total of 9300 combatants.</p>
<p>The brigade under Jaramillo had its headquarters in Taal, Batangas
Province, with outlying detachments at Batangas, Calac&aacute;,
Li&aacute;n Balayan and Punta Santiago, and a force holding the line of
the Pansipit River, altogether amounting to 1000 men, leaving 1600 free
to operate.</p>
<p>Besides this a fourth brigade, not belonging to the division, having
General Galbis as brigadier, was extended along the northern bank of
the Zapote River, under the immediate orders of the governor-general.
The Lakes of Bay and Bombon (Taal) were guarded by armed steam-launches
and other small craft, whilst the gunboats of the squadron patrolled
the sea coast. The rebel province was thus held in a grip of iron.</p>
<p>On the 12th February, 1897, General Lachambre reported himself ready
to advance. General Polavieja ordered Jaramillo to attack the rebel
trenches at Bayuyungan on the 14th, and to keep up the attack until
Lachambre had seized Silang, when he was to attack Talisay on the Lake
of Taal. The marines at Dalahican were ordered to attack Noveleta,
whilst Lachambre was to advance on the 15th, the two brigades taking
different routes, but converging on Silang.</p>
<p>The march was extremely difficult, and the nine-centim&egrave;tre
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>guns were only taken through, at the cost of most
strenuous efforts. The enemy tenaciously defended every favourable
position, and were only driven off at the cost of many lives.</p>
<p>On the 19th, Silang, one of the principal rebel towns, was taken by
assault and at the point of the bayonet, after a preparatory
bombardment in which the artillery fired 105 rounds of shell, whilst
25,000 rifle cartridges were used by the infantry.</p>
<p>The rebels lost 2000 men killed and wounded, whilst the Spanish
losses were 12 killed and 70 wounded. The town was strongly entrenched
and stoutly defended, and its capture with so small a loss may justly
be called a creditable operation. Marina&rsquo;s brigade attacked from
the south and Cornell&rsquo;s brigade from the east.</p>
<p>The action lasted from 7 to 11.30 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> The
rebels were discouraged, but still, on the 22nd, they delivered an
attack as if they would retake the town, and pressed on with great
fury. They killed four of the Spaniards and wounded twenty-one, but in
the end were driven off, leaving 400 dead on the ground. The houses in
Silang were found fully furnished and provisioned. In the house of the
so-called Viceroy of Silang, Victor Belarmino, the principal ornament
of the sala was a chromo-lithograph portrait of the Queen Regent.</p>
<p>The church-doors were wide open and the altars profusely
illuminated. On the sacristy table lay the priestly robes and
ornaments, ready, doubtless, for the celebration of a Te Deum for the
expected victory. But he who was to wear them, the celebrated Tagal
Bishop, lay with a bullet through his heart across the parapet he had
fiercely defended.</p>
<p>Lachambre preserved the best houses around the church and convent
and utilised them as storehouses, hospital, and barracks, burning the
rest of the town as a punishment to the rebels. He then garrisoned and
fortified the post and connected it with the telegraph line.</p>
<p>On the 24th Lachambre marched from Silang, his main body advancing
by the direct route to Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as parallel to the River
Casundit, a flanking force of three companies guarding the left of the
column, whilst Lieutenant Colonel Villalon, with a battalion and a half
having started an hour earlier than the main body, took the road to
Palimparan, having the Rio Grande on his right, and by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>his
advance protecting the right flank of the column. Villalon advanced
rapidly, and, brushing aside all opposition, rushed Palimparan with a
loss of one killed and one wounded, killing seven of the rebels in the
attack. Here he bivouacked, and at sunset was joined by another force
consisting of half a brigade under Colonel Arizon, detached from
General Galbis&rsquo; force on the Zapote River.</p>
<p>In the meantime the main body had advanced to within three miles of
Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as and bivouacked at the hamlet called Sampalcoc.
On the following day Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as was taken by assault,
after a short bombardment by the mountain batteries. The rebels were
strongly entrenched, and made a stout resistance. They had flooded the
rice fields to the east of the town and rendered them impassable.</p>
<p>The town was attacked from the south and west, but it took hours of
hard fighting for the Spaniards to break in, and even then the rebels
fought hand to hand, and many preferred death to surrender. Those who
fled were taken in flank by Arizon&rsquo;s force, which approached the
northern end of the town from the eastward. The loss of the Spaniards
was 21 killed and 121 wounded, whilst the natives left 400 dead at the
foot of their defences, and a great number were killed outside the
town.</p>
<p>The early part of the defence was directed by Aguinaldo, but he fled
when the Spanish forces closed up, leaving Estrella, an ex-sergeant of
the Guardia Civil, in his place. Estrella fled later on when the
Spaniards had entered the town. Unintimidated by this rude lesson, the
rebels that same night fired into the town, and on the 27th they
attacked a column which went out to make a reconnaissance towards
Palimparan, and gave a mountain battery a chance, which they promptly
took, of getting at a dense body of them with case. The artillery fired
22 rounds in this action, and the infantry used 63,000 cartridges. The
Spanish loss was two killed and ten wounded, whilst the rebels lost at
least 300.</p>
<p>The church, convent, and stone homes round the Plaza of Perez
Dasmari&ntilde;as were loopholed and prepared for defence, and occupied
by a garrison of two companies of infantry. Owing, however, to the
difficulty of bringing up supplies, the division could not resume its
advance till the 7th March. Then the division took the eastern road to
Imus, whilst the half brigade under Arizon marched by a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>parallel
road on the right flank, which converged upon the Imus road at
Salitran, a village with a large stone estate-house belonging to the
Recollets, strongly entrenched and held by the rebels.</p>
<p>On arriving within range two guns of Cornell&rsquo;s brigade opened
fire on the estate-house from an eminence, but after the fifth round
the Spanish flag was shown from the house, it having been occupied by
Arizon&rsquo;s force arriving from the east after a very slight
resistance, for the rebels seemed to have no one in command. They had
prepared for an attack from the east, but when they found the Spaniards
arriving in great force upon their right flank, enfilading their strong
entrenchments, they became demoralised and took to flight.</p>
<p>The scouts now reported that a formidable entrenchment a mile and a
quarter long, was occupied by the rebels about a mile north of the
village. This entrenchment, called Anabo II., covered both the roads to
Imus, and each flank rested on a deep ravine&mdash;the eastern end had
a redoubt, and the western end a flanking epaulement.</p>
<p>The ground in front was perfectly open, and there was difficulty in
making a flanking attack, so General Zabala, with a half brigade, made
a direct attack. The fighting line gradually advanced, taking such
cover as the <i>pil&aacute;piles</i> of the rice-fields could give,
until they arrived within 100 yards of the parapet, when Zabala, waving
high his sword, gave the order for the assault, falling a moment after
pierced through the breast by a shot from a <i>lantaca</i>. Two
captains fell near him, but the lieutenants led their companies to the
assault; the cazadores sprang across the ditch and clambered up the
high parapet with the agility and fury of leopards, bayoneting those of
the defenders who remained to fight it out, and sending volley after
volley into those who had taken to flight.</p>
<p>The Spanish loss was 11 killed and 33 wounded, whilst 200 of the
rebels were killed. This heavy loss did not however appear to
intimidate them in the least, for on the 8th they made two desperate
attempts to retake the position, in both of which they came within
close range of the Spaniards, who poured repeated volleys into them by
word of command, whilst the mountain-guns played upon them with
<span class="corr" id="xd20e4602" title="Source: case">ease</span>. In
this action the Spaniards lost 5 killed and 25 wounded, and they
calculated the rebel killed at 300. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the 10th (March) the division marched to
Presa-Molino, which was occupied that same evening, and leaving three
companies of infantry to guard the position, the division continued its
march through a most difficult country, arriving in the afternoon on
the Zapote River, in touch with the 4th Brigade, formerly commanded by
Galbis and now by Barraquer.</p>
<p>From there Lachambre with his staff rode over to Para&ntilde;aque,
and reported himself to the Captain-General Polavieja.</p>
<p>The troops encamped on the downs of San Nicolas, one brigade on each
side of the River Zapote. Notwithstanding the comparatively favourable
emplacement of the camp, the troops and their officers suffered
severely from the effect of the climate upon frames weakened by
over-exertion, by indifferent nourishment and by sleeping on the
ground. Malarial fevers, intestinal catarrh, dysentery, and rheumatism
sapped their vitality, whilst nostalgia preyed upon the younger
soldiers and depressed their spirits. Since the 15th February the
division had lost in killed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>wounded, and invalided, no less than
135 officers, and troops in greater proportion.</p>
<p>Yet still greater exertions were to be required from the soldiers.
The 4th Brigade was incorporated in the division, and two additional
battalions, one from the 3rd Brigade and the other from the Independent
Brigade, brought the number of combatants nearly up to 12,000.</p>
<p>Having previously made a practicable road by Almansa to Presa Molino
and Salitran, defended by redoubts at the most difficult fords, and
having organised his transport with such means as the country afforded,
Lachambre again set out, his objective being Imus, but the attack was
to be from Salitran.</p>
<p>The work of the native engineer soldiers, and of the 74th Native
Regiment in constructing this road and the redoubts, merits the highest
praise, and it must be admitted that it is almost impossible for an
army of white men to carry on a campaign in the Philippines or in
similar territory, without the assistance of native pioneer or engineer
troops.</p>
<p>The road being ready, and the convoys of provisions having gone
forward, on the morning of the 22nd March the division started on its
march to Salitran, where it arrived on the evening of the 23rd, having
had some sharp skirmishes on the way.</p>
<p>Early on the 24th the division set out for Imus, and once more the
formidable trenches and redoubts of Anabo II., restored, strengthened,
and crowded with determined defenders, barred their path. These works
had once already been taken by assault, and had cost the division the
loss of the brave General Zabala and other officers and men.</p>
<p>Protected on each flank by a deep ravine with a river at the bottom,
and with open ground in front, the attack had been rendered more
difficult by flooding the arable land before the trenches, and the
position of the rebels was an exceedingly strong one. Lachambre had to
accept a direct attack, but he sent a body of troops forward on each
flank to advance simultaneously and overlap the ends of the
entrenchment.</p>
<p>The infantry deployed, the firing line advanced under fire without
stopping to within three hundred yards of the parapet, when they
halted, taking what cover they could and keeping up a steady fire. Then
the mountain battery <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99"
name="pb99">99</a>]</span>was brought up and fired common shell at
close range, breaching the parapet. A rush forward soon brought the
firing-line within 150 yards of the parapet. General Marina, watching
the engagement well to the front, had one of his staff officers killed
at his side; seeing the favourable moment arrive, he gave the order for
the assault.</p>
<p>Once more the troops exhibited their conspicuous bravery. The long
line, led by its officers, dashed forward with the bayonet, the bugles
sounding the charge, and with impetuous speed, soon reached the
parapet. However terrible the attack, the stout-hearted Tagals stood
firm, disdaining to fly.</p>
<p>Bolo and bayonet clashed, European courage and Malay fury had full
play, till in the end, as ever in equal numbers and in stand-up fight,
the European prevailed. Many of the defenders fell, the rest sought
safety in flight.</p>
<p>The engagement lasted two and a half hours without cessation, and
over three hundred rebel dead were counted in or near the works,
amongst them was Crispulo Aguinaldo, a brother of General Emilio
Aguinaldo. The Spaniards lost 9 killed and 108 wounded.</p>
<p>After a short rest the division resumed the advance upon Imus, and
bivouacked after marching about a couple of miles.</p>
<p>On the 25th the advance was continued on a broad front. Scarcely had
the division marched for half-an-hour when the leading ranks came in
sight of another line of entrenchments more than two miles long, six
feet high, and five feet thick, well protected with cane fences in
front, one of these being at a distance of 100 yards from the
parapet.</p>
<p>Lachambre orders the centre to make a direct attack and the wings a
flanking movement. The rebels retain their fire till the Spaniards
arrive within two hundred yards, and then the parapet is crowned with
flame both from small arms and lantacas. The scene of the day before
was repeated, the parapet stormed, with a rebel loss of over six
hundred. After a short halt the advance against Imus was resumed. The
distance was short, and the appearance of the thousands of bayonets and
the explosion of a few shells produced an indescribable panic amongst
the inhabitants and the many who had come from other towns to assist in
the defence.</p>
<p>They took to flight, disregarding the protests of their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>leaders Emilio Aguinaldo and Andr&eacute;s
Bonifacio. In order to cover his retreat, the former ordered the
magazine to be blown up and the town to be burned. This delayed the
advance of the Spaniards in the centre, but the wings moved forward and
the thousands of fugitives were exposed to a flanking fire, and more
than eight hundred of them bit the dust. It was afternoon before
Lachambre could enter what remained of Imus, when as a mark of honour
for their splendid services, the colour of the 74th Regiment of Native
Infantry was raised upon the tower of the church&mdash;all the troops
presenting arms and afterwards giving enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>Thus was taken the citadel of the Katipunan with a loss to the
Spaniards of 25 killed and 129 wounded.</p>
<p>The taking of Imus gave General Polavieja an opportunity of offering
an amnesty to the rebels, which he did not neglect. On the 26th of
March he issued a proclamation offering pardon to all who had borne
arms against the Royal Authority, or who had assisted the rebels,
provided they presented themselves before Palm Sunday the 11th of
April. Leaders of the rebels were to present themselves with their
forces and arms.</p>
<p>On the 26th March the division, leaving a garrison in Imus, started
for Bacoor to take the defences in reverse, and such was the effect on
the rebels of their defeat at Imus and of the advance in overwhelming
force, that they fled, and the division occupied Bacoor almost without
firing a shot.</p>
<p>It was otherwise with Binacayan, for Marina&rsquo;s Brigade having
made a reconnaissance in force on the 28th, were received with a heavy
fire, and after an hour&rsquo;s skirmish in which some were killed on
each side, they returned to their camp at Bacoor; Lachambre considering
that an attack in that direction would result in a useless waste of
life, for the advance would be along narrow causeways across swamps.
Having received provisions and ammunition by sea from Manila, he
returned with his division to Imus, the garrison of which had not been
molested by the rebels.</p>
<p>At daylight on the 31st March, the division left Imus and marched
across country in a westerly and southerly direction, fording numerous
streams running at the bottom of deep ravines, as well as many
irrigating canals and ditches. Soon after the start the right flank was
fired upon, the fire increasing as the column moved forward. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>engineers had to improve the approaches to the
fords of the Rivers Julian and Batong Dalig under fire.</p>
<p>The leading brigade carried several entrenchments on its front and
flank without halting, but extending skirmishes on either flank to beat
off the enemy. The rear brigade was attacked on both flanks and had to
fight a rearguard action as well. The division bivouacked for the night
at Bacao, a point from which it threatened the rebel towns of San
Francisco, Santa Cruz, Rosario and Noveleta, all within easy reach.</p>
<p>The losses on the day&rsquo;s march were 6 killed and 37 wounded,
whilst 400 rebel killed were counted on open ground, and many must have
fallen amongst the bushes and trees.</p>
<p>They, however, were not at all dismayed, and surrounded the bivouac
at night, firing repeated volleys and engaging the outposts.</p>
<p>On the following day (1st April), the division with all its baggage
crossed the River Ladron, and took up a position in the centre of a
large tract of rice-fields, having Noveleta on the north, San Francisco
on the south, Rosario and Santa Cruz to the west, and San Antonio on
the east. San Antonio was first taken by assault after the parapet had
been breached by the fire of two batteries of mountain guns. The
fugitive Tagals who escaped with their lives took refuge in
Noveleta.</p>
<p>The situation was now as follows: Arizon&rsquo;s Brigade threatened
Noveleta, Marina&rsquo;s Brigade threatened Rosario and
Sarralde&rsquo;s Brigade attacked Santa Cruz&mdash;the baggage being in
the centre and out of fire.</p>
<p>At this moment a dense mass of the enemy issuing from San Francisco,
made a desperate attack upon the Spaniards nearest to them.</p>
<p>The whole of the division with its twelve guns, was now in action
and surrounded by the enemy, Lachambre in the centre keenly watching
the fight. When he judged the right moment had arrived, he ordered
Arizon&rsquo;s Brigade to storm Noveleta.</p>
<p>The Brigade greeted this order with thundering shouts of &ldquo;Viva
Espa&ntilde;a,&rdquo; and with the pluck that has always distinguished
the Spanish soldier when well led, carried the entrenchments at a run,
and fought a hand to hand combat with the defenders, who were either
killed or driven out, notwithstanding that these were the very best of
the rebel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>troops, amongst them being many of
Aguinaldo&rsquo;s Guards, wearing a special uniform, some of them
having served in the native regiments. Here, again, the 74th Native
Infantry distinguished themselves by their remarkable bravery, and once
more their colour was displayed from the church tower as a recognition
of their valuable and loyal services.</p>
<p>The capture of Noveleta placed the division in communication with
the marines occupying the entrenchments of Dalahican.</p>
<p>This action cost the division 11 killed and 58 wounded, but many
hundreds of the rebels were killed.</p>
<p>In consequence of this, the rebels abandoned Cavite, Viejo, and
Binacayan, which were occupied the following day without
resistance.</p>
<p>The rebels, however, on the 4th, and again on the 5th, attacked the
troops in Noveleta and sustained the combat for some time, killing 10
and wounding 33 Spanish, but leaving 50 of their own dead on the
ground.</p>
<p>On the 6th the division marched from Noveleta, which was occupied by
a garrison of marines, and took the direction of San Francisco, the
advanced guard in extended order across the same open ground upon which
the engagement of April 1st was fought. The rebel positions on the
right flank were marked by lines of skirmishers with their supports and
reserves. The Tagals had, however, inundated the part of this plain
immediately in front of the town, and the advance was made with great
difficulty; the guns and ammunition boxes having to be carried by the
gunners with the assistance of the infantry. With undaunted bravery the
troops struggled on under a heavy fire, but Lachambre, realising the
difficulty and the danger incurred, changed the direction of the
advance. The right wing under Arizon inclined to the right, and the
left, under Marina, bore away to the left. Half a brigade crossed the
River Ladron, notwithstanding the opposition of the rebels, and
attacked the town from the east. Firmer ground was soon reached, the
guns that had cost so much labour taking up, were mounted, and a rain
of shell soon fell amongst the rebels. The infantry poured in steady
volleys, advancing in the intervals of firing. The whole combined
attack being within a proper distance for the final rush, Lachambre
gave the word, and like greyhounds released, the Spanish and native
infantry leaped to the assault. The parapet <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>was
high and deep the ditch, for the defenders had not spared their labour
on it, and as the Spanish line reached the edge, the rebels boldly
mounted the parapet and discharged their arms at close quarters. In
this critical moment the moral superiority of the white man once more
was manifest. The Spanish troops reached the parapet and a hand-to-hand
combat with the bolder rebels took place, the bayonet against the spear
or bolo. The less-determined of the enemy fled, and in a few minutes
120 Tagals lay dead against the parapet, and five guns and eighty
rifles remained as trophies to the victors. The companies re-formed for
the pursuit, but the enemy fired the thatched huts to interpose a
curtain of flame between them and their pursuers; a measure which was
only partially successful, for some of the troops, nimbly darting
through the lanes, shot down or bayoneted many of the fugitives,
killing 400 in the pursuit, besides those who died at the
entrenchments. The Spanish loss was 25 killed and 125 wounded,
including several officers. The fighting had lasted four hours over
very difficult ground, and the troops were exhausted. Lachambre
therefore camped in the town, which has many fine edifices and a
spacious, church and convent. The bells of the church, in a joyful
peal, announced the Spanish triumph. The rebels were under the command
of Andr&eacute;s Bonifacio, the President of the formidable Katipunan.
This terrible blow to the insurrection was followed by the occupation
of the towns of Santa Cruz and Rosario, without firing a shot.</p>
<p>Many of the natives had joined the rebellion under compulsion, and
had long desired to submit themselves. Now they came in by hundreds
every day to claim the amnesty offered by General Polavieja.</p>
<p>Fifty-two days had the campaign lasted, fifty-seven combats had
taken place, and the total loss of the division was 1 general, 14
officers, and 168 men killed, and 56 officers and 910 men wounded.
Probably a far larger number died or were invalided from disease,
induced by the fatigue, exposure and privations inseparable from such a
campaign, especially as most of the men were mere youths, raw recruits,
and with little possibility of taking care of themselves, even if they
knew how. Notwithstanding the excessive fatigue and the depressing
nature of the surroundings, the Spanish troops maintained a fine
martial spirit, and ever showed themselves ready to respond
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>to the calls made upon them. They were well led
by their officers, who devoted themselves unsparingly in their
country&rsquo;s service, and they had confidence in their generals, who
were untiring in their exertions to do their best for their men.
Lachambre displayed the greatest solicitude for the well-being of the
force under his command; whilst showing the utmost resolution, and
pushing his attacks home in every case, yet he sacrificed his men as
little as possible, and always had patience to wait till his flanking
attacks could join in the assault. The distances the division had to
traverse were very small, but the absence of roads and bridges made the
provisioning of the army a matter of the utmost difficulty.</p>
<p>Those who know the poverty of the Spanish Army in animals, vehicles,
and stores, will understand what Lachambre and his staff accomplished.
On the 12th April, 1897, the division was broken up, and the brigades
were stationed at various places in Cavite and the neighbouring
provinces.</p>
<p>The general, brigadiers, officers, and troops, are fortunate in
having as chronicler of their exploits, so painstaking and appreciative
an officer as Lieut.-Colonel Don Federico de Monteverde y Sedano, who
in his book, &lsquo;La Division Lachambre,&rsquo; published in 1898,
gives a detailed account of the campaign, with sketches illustrative of
the various actions. Se&ntilde;or Monteverde does justice to every
Spaniard, from the divisional-general downwards. I could wish he had
said something more about the services of the 73rd and 74th Regiments
of Native Infantry, who seem to have been always in the forefront of
the battle and where the hardest work was being done, as in assisting
the magnificent engineer corps, without whom I doubt if the campaign
could have been successful. His book, however, is invaluable to those
who may have to conduct operations in the Philippines, and the
invariable success achieved by Lachambre, contrasts remarkably with the
failures in the early part of the rebellion, and one cannot help seeing
a parallel between this little war and the greater one in South Africa.
Each was mismanaged at the beginning, but as soon as the invading
forces were organised in one command, success was achieved.</p>
<p>A few days after the breaking up of the division, General Polavieja
embarked for Spain, very much broken in health. In a letter written on
the 9th March to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105"
name="pb105">105</a>]</span>Minister of War, Polavieja declared himself
too ill to ride and asked for his relief. He, however, still remained
at Para&ntilde;aque, directing the campaign till after the capture of
San Francisco.</p>
<p>The Spanish press took sides for or against him, the papers
advocating the interests of the friars praised him, whilst the Liberal
press held him up to ridicule.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that he directed the military operations in an
efficient manner, but under his government the arbitrary arrests,
cruelties, and tortures, inflicted upon all who were suspected of being
sympathisers with the rebels, or from whom money would be extorted,
that had begun under Blanco, continued and increased. For Blanco,
having been informed of the cruelties inflicted, issued an order
forbidding the practice.</p>
<p>The next governor-general was General Primo de Rivera, who had held
that office from 1880 to 1883, and had found it a very profitable one.
He arrived on the 23rd April and went to the front on the 29th; on the
4th May, Naic was taken, also a small place called Quintana, and
Indang. At Naic there was very heavy fighting, and some at Indang.</p>
<p>The troops then advanced to Maragond&oacute;n, which was taken on
the 10th after a most stubborn resistance, the Spaniards losing many
men and the rebels still more heavily.</p>
<p>This place was the last where the rebels made a stand, in Cavite
province. After this defeat they dispersed in roving bands and kept on
the move.</p>
<p>The whole province was a scene of desolation, towns burnt, churches
bombarded, stone houses blown up, property looted, putrefying bodies
lying about in hundreds, the fields laid waste, the cattle driven off,
the country depopulated, a remnant of the inhabitants hiding in the
woods; a few of the bolder ones returned to the ruined houses. Such was
the result of this unhappy rebellion.</p>
<p>I have this description from an eye-witness, and he assured me that
he had been told by a colonel commanding one of the most distinguished
regiments engaged in the campaign, that not less than 30,000 natives
lost their lives in that province alone during the rebellion.</p>
<p>The rebels gave no quarter to Spaniards, and the Spaniards only
occasionally took prisoners. However, once <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>taken they were usually released after being
exhorted to return to their homes.</p>
<p>Whilst the operations of Lachambre&rsquo;s division were proceeding
in Cavite, General Monet, with a force of 3000 men, was carrying on an
indiscriminate butchery of men, women, and children, in Bulacan and
Pampanga, but he displayed no military qualities, and ultimately
escaped, leaving his forces to surrender.</p>
<p>The Spanish Volunteers in Manila continued their series of
abominable outrages, although in August, Primo de Rivera issued a
decree forbidding intimidation, plundering and ravishing. He was
ultimately obliged to disband them.</p>
<p>Driven out of Cavite, the remnant of the rebels under Aguinaldo took
refuge in the hills and held a strong position near Angat, in the
province of Bulacan. As it would have taken a long time to reduce them,
Primo de Rivera tried conciliation, and employed Don Pedro Paterno, a
native gentleman of means, who had been educated in Spain, as mediator.
By his instrumentality, an arrangement was arrived at which, after
being approved by the Government in Madrid, was signed by the mediator
as attorney for the rebels and the governor-general for Spain.</p>
<p>This, known as the pact of Biak-na-bato, was signed on December
14th, 1897.</p>
<p>In consequence, Aguinaldo and a number of the prominent rebels were
escorted to Hong Kong by a relative of the governor-general, and there
received a sum of $400,000, being the first instalment of the sum
agreed upon.</p>
<p>They lived in a quiet and economical manner upon their own
resources. They did not divide the indemnity nor convert it to their
own use, but kept it as a war fund in case of need.</p>
<p>The event showed the wisdom of this course, for Primo de Rivera had
led them to understand that an amnesty and reforms were to follow, but,
apparently, had caused the Spanish Government to look upon the
arrangement in a very different light, and he subsequently denied that
any treaty existed. No reforms were ever granted, and things in Luzon
went on in the same old way. The friars joined in raising a large
subscription for Primo de Rivera, and this seemed to incline him more
favourably towards them.</p>
<p>The amnesty was disregarded, and the priests continued their
arbitrary courses against those who had been concerned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>in
the rebellion. Bands of marauders infested the provinces and the
country was in a very unsettled state, some insurgent bands approaching
Cavite.</p>
<p>On March 24th, the 74th Regiment of Native Infantry in garrison at
that town, the regiment that had distinguished itself so remarkably in
Lachambre&rsquo;s division, being always in the front, was ordered to
march out against them. Whatever the reason, whether they felt that
their splendid services had not been duly acknowledged, or, as is
likely, their pay was months in arrears, they refused to march against
their own countrymen. Eight corporals were called out of the ranks and
shot then and there in the presence of the regiment, which was again
ordered to advance, and a threat made that a refusal would mean death
to all.</p>
<p>All did refuse and were sent to barracks to await sentence. The next
morning the entire regiment with arms and equipment, marched out and
deserted in a body to the insurgents, saying they were willing to fight
the foreign enemies of Spain, but not against their own friends. The
following day another regiment joined them, but I have no note of its
number.</p>
<p>It was now that an event occurred in Manila that showed how little
desire there was amongst the Spaniards to treat the natives with
ordinary justice, much less to conciliate them.</p>
<p>This was the massacre of the Calle de Camba, quite a short distance
from the American Consulate, and it was perpetrated on the 25th and
26th of March. On the first of those day a number of Visayan sailors
from the vessels in the Pasig had assembled in a house in the above
street, which was their usual resort.</p>
<p>Somehow the story got about that an illegal assembly was being held,
and the police, without more ado, attacked the meeting and shot down a
dozen, taking sixty-two prisoners. The next morning the whole of these
prisoners were marched to the cemetery, and all shot, though many them
were known to have been merely passing by at the time.</p>
<p>This is vouched for by Mr. Oscar F. Williams in an official letter
to Mr. Cridler, dated 27th March, 1898. It could hardly have been a
mere coincidence that a revolt of the Visayas broke out about ten days
later, when they made a desperate attack upon the city of Ceb&uacute;
in which many lives were lost and much property damaged. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p>It seems hardly worth while to relate any more instances of Tagal
revenge or Spanish brutality. The country that had been almost pacified
was now again in revolt and amongst the insurgents were two battalions
of well-trained and veteran troops.</p>
<p>But now events were impending of transcendent importance&mdash;the
Spanish-American War had broken out.</p>
<p>Previously, however, Primo de Rivera left Manila to return to Spain,
but before going he granted an amnesty to all who had tortured
suspected persons to extort evidence from them.</p>
<p>Some of the victims had died under torture rather than bear witness
against their friends, for the Tagal is a Stoic after the manner of the
Red Indian. Others survive, mere wrecks, maimed for life, and living
mementoes of Spanish cruelty.</p>
<p>Torture for extracting evidence from suspected persons is illegal in
all Christian countries and their dependencies, and also in Japan, but
has not yet been entirely routed out in British India nor in Egypt. In
1897, four cases of police torture in the North-West Provinces and
Oudh, ended in convictions.</p>
<p>In Spain, some police officers are now on their trial for applying
the thumb-screw to the fingers of anarchist prisoners in the Castle of
Monjuich with such severity, that one of them, a railway porter, lost
the use of his hands and arms. And Ysabelo de los Reyes, a native of
Ilocos, declares that he was tortured in the same prison by thirst,
having been fed upon salt food and deprived of water.</p>
<p>Last March (1900), a captain of police was tried at Sambor, in
Austrian Galicia, for torturing prisoners with the thumb-screw and by
deprivation of food, and was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment.
In Corea, China, and Siam, torture forms part of the legal procedure
before sentence, to say nothing of the various and lingering deaths the
judge may order after the prisoner has confessed. Let us hope that now
there will be no more of it in the Philippines. <span class=

<h3 class="main">Manila Bay.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The width of the entrance to the vast Bay of Manila is
nine and a half marine miles from shore to shore. It is divided into
two unequal channels by the Island of Corregidor and Pulo Caballo, and
a rock called El Frayle, about a mile and a half from the southern
shore, farther reduces that channel.</p>
<p>The Boca Chica, or northern entrance between Corregidor Island and
Punta Lasisi, is two marine miles wide, and in the middle of the
channel the depth of water is about thirty fathoms.</p>
<p>The Boca Grande, or southern entrance between Pulo Caballo and El
Frayle, is three and a half marine miles wide, with a depth of water in
the fairway of about twenty fathoms. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>In both channels the tide rushes in and out with great force.</p>
<p>With channels of such a width there was no difficulty in taking a
squadron in at night, and little chance of suffering damage from the
hastily improvised batteries of the Spaniards.</p>
<p>And it will be evident to all having the slightest knowledge of
submarine mining that the conditions are most unfavourable to defence
by such means. As a matter of fact, the Spaniards possessed only nine
obsolete submarine mines fitted to explode by contact. These were sent
over to Corregidor, but were not sunk, as it was obvious that they were
useless.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was a perfect position for the employment of
torpedo boats or gunboats, there being excellent anchorage for such
craft on both sides of the Channel and in Corregidor Cove. But at the
time of the declaration of war, the Spaniards had no torpedo boats in
the Philippines. The Elswick-built cruisers <i>Isla de Cuba</i> and
<i>Isla de Luzon</i> were fitted with torpedoes, and might have been
watching the channels for a chance to use them. Admiral Montojo knows
best why he did not detach them on this service.</p>
<p>There was then nothing to prevent the entrance of the American
Squadron; the mines, torpedo boats and narrow channels only existed in
the imagination of some American newspaper correspondents.</p>
<p>But Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s exploit does not need any such enhancing,
it speaks for itself.</p>
<p>To any one having a knowledge of the Spanish navy, and especially of
the squadron of the Philippines, the result of an action against an
American Squadron of similar force could not be doubtful<span class=
"corr" id="xd20e4822" title="Source: ,">.</span> As a matter of fact
the Spanish ships, except the two small cruisers built at Elswick in
1887, were quite obsolete. The <i>Castilla</i> and <i>Reina
Cristina</i> were wooden vessels, standing very high out of the water,
and making admirable targets, whilst their guns were small, some of
them had been landed at Corregidor, though never placed in battery. The
boilers of one vessel were in the arsenal.</p>
<p>But even allowing for the fact that the tonnage of the American
Squadron was half as much again as that of the Spaniards, and that they
had more than twice as many, and heavier guns, no one would have
supposed it possible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span>that the Spanish Squadron could have been
completely destroyed without inflicting any damage upon the enemy.</p>
<p>It was indeed a brilliant victory, reflecting great credit upon
Admiral Dewey and the officers and crews of the American ships, not
only for what they did that day, but for their careful preparation that
enabled them to score so decided a success.</p>
<p>The Spanish sailors put up a good fight and showed pluck, but they
had no skill as gunners, and so failed in the hour of their
country&rsquo;s need. Admiral Montojo bravely commanded his fleet, but
as soon as the action was over he seems to have considered that his
duty had terminated, for he returned to his Villa in San Miguel,
leaving the remnants of his squadron and the Cavite arsenal to its
fate.</p>
<p>We must infer that Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s victory and its
consequences were not foreseen by the American Government, for they had
made no preparations to send troops to Manila, and from the time they
learned of the destruction of the Spanish Squadron, till they had
assembled a force strong enough to take and hold the city<span class=
"corr" id="xd20e4842" title="Source: .">,</span> three weary months
elapsed. This was a very hap-hazard way of making war, and the delay
cost many thousands of lives as will be seen later on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">General Aguinaldo.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the 19th May, 1898, Don Emilio Aguinaldo, former
chief of the insurgents, arrived in Manila in pursuance of an
arrangement with the American Consul-General at Singapore. He came with
a suite of seventeen persons on board an American gunboat, and after an
interview with Admiral Dewey, was landed at Cavite and given two
field-pieces, a number of rifles and a supply of ammunition.</p>
<p>He soon reasserted himself as the leader of the insurrection, which
was already in active progress, and gained some signal successes
against the Spaniards. On the 24th May he issued a proclamation
enjoining his followers to make war in a civilized manner and to
respect property.</p>
<p>I do not intend to discuss the negotiations between Mr. Pratt and
Aguinaldo, nor between the latter and Admiral Dewey. This subject has
been very fully treated by Mr. Foreman in the second edition of his
book. The treating with Aguinaldo was not approved by Mr. Day at
Washington, and the Consul-General and Consuls who had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>participated in it, and even taken credit for
it, were severely rapped over the knuckles and promptly adopted an
apologetic tone (see Blue Book). But whatever was the agreement with
Aguinaldo, it is evident that had it not been for his assistance and
that of the insurgents, the Spanish forces could have retired from
Manila to Tarlac or other place inland out of reach of the guns of the
fleet and could have prolonged their resistance for years.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Tagal Republic.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Tagals had made much progress since the
insurrection of 1896&ndash;7. Their ideas had advanced considerably
since their rudimentary organization in the Province of Cavite, as can
be gathered from the improved style of the various proclamations and
decrees published by Aguinaldo.</p>
<p>They now organized a Government, a real Civil Administration,
extending over a great part of Luzon, and sent an expedition to
Visayas. They established a Constitution, a representative government,
and reopened the courts and schools, whilst the native clergy carried
on public worship as usual. Aguinaldo repeatedly asserted the
determination of the Tagal people to fight to the death for
independence. At this time the insurgents held 9000 Spaniards as
prisoners of war, and they claimed to have 30,000 men under arms.</p>
<p>Paymaster Wilcox, U.S.N., and Mr. Leonard R. Sargent who travelled
through part of Luzon for more than 600 miles, and during six weeks,
reported<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4865src" href="#xd20e4865" name=
"xd20e4865src">1</a> to Admiral Dewey that a regular and orderly
Administration had been established, and was in full working order.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo was at the head of this Government and of the army
<i>co-operating</i> with the American forces by the written request of
General Anderson. This should have ensured him and those with him at
the very least courteous and considerate treatment at the hands of the
American Commanders, and in fact he received this from Admiral Dewey.
But as soon as the direction of affairs passed into the hands of the
general commanding the army the deeply-rooted contempt felt by
Americans for the coloured races was allowed full play, Aguinaldo and
his staff found themselves ignored, or treated with scarcely veiled
contempt, and the estrangement was gradually increased. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>I do not know which party was the aggressor on February the 4th,
1899, each swears that it was the other. The <i>cui bono</i> test cuts
both ways, for whilst it appears that the attack on Manila secured two
doubtful votes in the Senate for the ratification of the Treaty whereby
the Philippines were bought from Spain, on the other hand, Aguinaldo
may have felt it necessary to prove to America that the Philippines
would fight rather than bow their necks to the Yankee yoke. So that
both parties may have had an interest in beginning hostilities. In any
case, the next day Aguinaldo offered to withdraw to a greater distance
if an armistice was arranged, but Otis declared that &ldquo;fighting
must go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Personally, I think that if a sympathetic and conciliatory attitude
had been adopted, had the local government established been recognized,
had Aguinaldo and his staff been given commissions in the Native Army
or Civil Service, and the flower of the Tagal Army taken into the
service of the United States, a peaceful settlement could have been
made on the lines of a Protectorate.</p>
<p>I therefore look upon the war as unnecessary, and consider the lives
already sacrificed, and that will have to be sacrificed, as absolutely
thrown away.</p>
<p>The tragical side of American unpreparedness is manifest in the
state of anarchy in which the whole Archipelago has been plunged by the
American unreadiness to occupy the military posts as soon as they were
vacated by the Spanish garrisons. A hideous orgy of murder, plunder,
and slave-raiding has prevailed in Visayas, and especially in
Mindanao.</p>
<p>Three conditions were essential to a peaceful settlement:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;A broad-minded and sympathetic representative of
America, fully authorized to treat, and a lover of peace.</p>
<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;A strict discipline amongst the American
forces.</p>
<p><i>Third.</i>&mdash;The principal aim and object of the Tagal
insurrection must be secured.</p>
<p>General Otis does not seem to me to fulfil the first condition, he
lacked prestige and patience, and he showed that he had an insufficient
conception of the magnitude of his task by occupying himself with petty
details of all kinds and by displaying an ill-timed parsimony.
Apparently he had no power to grant anything at all, and only dealt in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>vague generalities which the Tagals could not be
expected to accept.</p>
<p>As regards the second point, I regret that I am not personally
acquainted with the gentlemen from Nebraska, Colorado, Dakota and other
states serving in the United States Army or volunteers. I have no doubt
that they are good fighting-men, but from all I can hear about them
they are not conspicuous for strict military discipline, and too many
of them have erroneous ideas as to the most suitable drink for a
tropical climate.</p>
<p>Manila was in the time of the Spaniards a most temperate city; a
drunken man was a very rare sight, and would usually be a foreign
sailor. Since the American occupation, some hundreds of drinking
saloons have been opened, and daily scenes of drunkenness and
debauchery have filled the quiet natives with alarm and horror. When
John L. Motley wrote his scathing denunciation of the army which the
great Duke of Alva led from Spain into the Low Countries, &ldquo;to
enforce the high religious purposes of Philip II.,<span class="corr"
id="xd20e4911" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> not foresee that
his words would be applicable to an American Army sent to subjugate men
struggling to be free &ldquo;for their welfare, not our gain,&rdquo;
nor that this army, besides bringing in its train a flood of
cosmopolitan harlotry,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4914src" href=
"#xd20e4914" name="xd20e4914src">2</a> would be allowed by its
commander to inaugurate amongst a strictly temperate people a mad
saturnalia of drunkenness that has scarcely a parallel.</p>
<p>Such, however, is undoubtedly the case, and I venture to think that
these occurrences have confirmed many of the Tagals in their resolve
rather to die fighting for their independence than to be ruled over by
such as these.</p>
<p>More important still was it to take care that the Tagal insurrection
should not have been in vain. That rebellion probably cost fifty
thousand human lives, immense loss of property, and untold misery. It
was fought against the friars and was at last triumphant. The Spanish
friars had been expelled and their lands confiscated. Were the
Americans to bring them back and guarantee them in peaceable
possession, once more riveting on the chain the Tagals had torn off?
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>This seems to have been General Otis&rsquo; intention. I think he
might have stood upon the accomplished fact. But he did not.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Peace under Article VIII. declares that the cession
cannot in any respect impair the rights of ecclesiastical bodies to
acquire and possess property, whilst Article IX. allows Spanish
subjects to remain in the Islands, to sell or dispose of their property
and to carry on their professions. Presumably General Otis felt bound
by the Treaty in which these general stipulations had been embodied by
the Peace Commission, in direct contradiction to the advice given them
by Mr. Foreman (see p. 463, 55th Congress, 3rd Sess., Doc. No. 62, part
1), who pointed out the necessity of confiscating these lands, but Mr.
Gray replied: &ldquo;We have no law which will allow us to arbitrarily
do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the effect of the treaty was known, Archbishop Nozaleda,
who had fled to China from the vengeance he feared, returned to Manila.
He seemed to have a good deal of interest with General Otis, and this
did not please the natives, nor inspire them with confidence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was reported and generally believed that the
friars&rsquo; vast estates had been purchased by an American Syndicate
who would in due time take possession and exploit them.</p>
<p>One can understand the Tagals&rsquo; grief and desperation; all
their blood and tears shed in vain! The friars triumphant after
all!</p>
<p>I do not wish to trace the particulars of the wretched war that
commenced February, 1899, and is still (October, 1900) proceeding.</p>
<p>In it the Americans do not seem to have displayed the
resourcefulness and <span class="corr" id="xd20e4937" title=
"Source: adaptibility">adaptability</span> one would have expected from
them. For my part, I expected a great deal, for so many American
generals being selected from men in the active exercise of a
profession, or perhaps controlling the administration of some vast
business, they ought naturally to have developed their faculties, by
constant use, to a far greater degree than men who have vegetated in
the futile routine of a barrack or military station. They prevailed in
every encounter, but their advance was very slow, and their troops
suffered many preventible hardships. We know very little as to what
happened, for the censors, acting under instructions from General Otis,
prevented the transmission <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href=
"#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>of accurate information; nothing
was cabled, except the accounts of victories gained by the American
troops.</p>
<p>It would not be right, however, to pass over the fighting without
rendering due tribute to the heroism of the American officers and
soldiers.</p>
<p>Who can forget Colonel Funston&rsquo;s gallant exploit in crossing
the Rio Grande on a raft under fire with two companies of Kansas
Infantry and enfilading the Tagals&rsquo; position? Or his leading part
of same regiment in a charge upon an enemy&rsquo;s earthwork near Santo
Tom&aacute;s, where he was wounded?</p>
<p>What could be finer than the late Colonel Stotsenburg&rsquo;s
leading of the Nebraska regiment in the attack on Qu&iacute;ngua, where
he was killed? And since we are speaking of brave men, shall we not
remember the late General Antonio Luna and his gallant rally of his
army in the advance from Macab&eacute;be, when he fearlessly exposed
himself on horseback to the American fire, riding along the front of
his line? To justify the slow progress of the army, jungles, forests,
swamps and hills were introduced on the perfectly flat arable land such
as that around Malolos, Calumpit, and San Fernando, extending in fact
all the way from Manila to Tarlac.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4948src"
href="#xd20e4948" name="xd20e4948src">3</a> This country supports a
dense population, and almost every bit of it has been under the plough
for centuries. The only hill is Arayat. During the dry season, say from
November to May or June, the soil is baked quite hard, and vehicles or
guns can traverse any part of it with slight assistance from the
pioneers. The only obstacles are the small rivers and creeks, mostly
fordable, and having clumps of bamboos growing on their banks providing
a perfect material for temporary bridges or for making rafts.</p>
<p>The campaign was marked by an absence of co-operation between the
land and sea forces. Admiral Dewey, apparently, was not pleased with
the way things were managed, for he is said to have stayed on board his
ship for months at a time. The warships remained at anchor in Manila
Bay whilst arms<a class="noteref" id="xd20e4956src" href="#xd20e4956"
name="xd20e4956src">4</a> and ammunition were landed at the outposts or
on the coasts without hindrance, and it was not till November that
troops were landed at Dagupan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117"
href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>the northern terminus of the
railway, though this obviously ought to have been done in February, so
as to attack the enemy front and rear.</p>
<p>The necessity for small gunboats soon made itself felt, but such was
the jealousy of the army towards the navy that it was decided that
these must be army gunboats, and General Otis is reported to have
purchased thirteen small gunboats at Zamboanga, in March 1899, without
consulting or informing Admiral Dewey or even asking for an escort for
them. It so happened that the Spaniards evacuated Zamboanga before any
American forces arrived, and the insurgents promptly took possession of
the gunboats already paid for and proceeded to plunder them of
everything useful to them. A native account says that they took the
gunboats up the Rio Grande into the interior, but this is denied by the
Americans. Ultimately a cruiser was sent down to convoy the gunboats,
and if I am correctly informed, they were commissioned in charge of
junior naval officers.</p>
<p>Obviously, the services of the navy should have been utilised to the
utmost extent, and advantage should have been taken of the prestige
they had gained by the victory over the Spaniards, and of the great
popularity and sympathetic personality of Admiral Dewey. A serious
responsibility rests upon whoever allowed jealousy to prevent the
co-operation of the land and sea forces, since by failing to secure
this they needlessly sacrificed the lives of American soldiers and
prolonged the war.</p>
<p>Lieut.-General Sir Andrew Clarke, R.E., a former governor of the
Straits Settlements, and the greatest authority in England on the
affairs of the Malay States and Islands, was good enough to write a
letter which was forwarded to Mr. Day, and published in the Blue Book,
p. 628.</p>
<p>He pointed out that, although a moderate military force might be
desirable at one or two important centres, a naval force was of more
value, especially gunboats able to move freely amongst the islands and
ascend the many rivers and inlets of the sea.</p>
<p>Therefore to the fleet and its officers he advised that political
and civil administration of the Philippines should, at least in the
first instance, be entrusted. Sir Andrew believed, and I venture to say
that I thoroughly agree with him, that amongst the officers of the
United States navy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118"
name="pb118">118</a>]</span>active and retired, can be found many men
of wide experience, broad views, and generous sympathy well fitted to
administer the affairs of the protectorate. Sir Andrew also advised, as
Foreman did, and as I do, that the members of the Religious Orders,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Augustinians, the Dominicans, the Franciscans, and the
Recollets, should be advised to return to Spain, receiving compensation
for their property.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Clarke summed up his advice as follows: &ldquo;Enlist
native sympathy by fairness and justice, and rule through native
agents, supervised by carefully selected American residents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the fleet, by destroying the Spanish squadron, had rendered it
possible to bring troops by sea, and by capturing the arsenal and
blockading the Port of Manila, had invigorated the insurrection, and in
fact had brought about the cession of the islands by Spain, it would
appear to outsiders that it and its officers had a strong claim to the
leading part in completing the settlement and pacification of the
Archipelago for which the best authorities considered them to possess
special qualifications. Besides, if peace was really wanted, it would
have been better to entrust the negotiations to the man who had had his
fight rather than to one looking for his chance. The craze for military
renown is nowhere more rampant than in the United States. Occasions are
few and far between, and we must not expect generals to throw them away
and fly in the face of Providence.</p>
<p>This, however, did not commend itself to those who pull the strings;
we ignore the reasons, but we see the result. Perhaps it was thought
that to allow Dewey to add to his victor&rsquo;s laurel wreath the palm
of the pacificator would be too much honour for one man, and might
raise him to an inconvenient height in the estimation of his fellow
citizens.</p>
<p>A year and twenty days after his decisive victory Admiral Dewey
sailed from Manila in his flagship. Wherever the British ensign flew he
was received with every demonstration of honour and respect both by
naval and military officers and by civilians. His reception in New York
was marked by an almost delirious enthusiasm. But long before he
arrived, Mr. Whitelaw Reid, disgusted with the conduct of the campaign,
made a speech at the Miami University and denounced the President for
neglect of duty which brought on the war in the Philippines.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;If the bitterest enemy of the United States had
sought to bring upon it in that quarter the greatest trouble in the
shortest time, he could have devised for that end no policy more
successful than the one we have already pursued.&rdquo; It must be
added that Mr. Whitelaw Reid, perhaps to prevent being accused of
having sympathy with the enemy, denounced Aguinaldo and the Tagals as
rebels, savages and treacherous barbarians, unfit for citizenship or
self-government, and declared that the Philippines belong to America by
right of conquest.</p>
<p>I suppose Mr. Whitelaw Reid, or perhaps any citizen of the United
States, has a right to denounce his own President, and certainly the
management of the Philippine annexation has been bad from the
beginning.</p>
<p>But I think Mr. McKinley was badly served by the Peace Commission.
They seem to me to have made many and egregious mistakes.</p>
<p>1. They took General Merritt&rsquo;s opinion that the Tagals would
submit, and accepted Mr. Foreman&rsquo;s assurance of Tagal plasticity
and accommodating nature.</p>
<p>2. They disregarded the intimation of D. Felipe Agoncillo, the
accredited agent of the Tagals, that these would accept no settlement
to which they were not parties.</p>
<p>3. They treated several millions of civilised Christian people like
a herd of cattle to be purchased with the ranch.</p>
<p>4. Under Article VIII., they guaranteed the religious orders the
possession of estates already taken from them.</p>
<p>5. Under Article IX., they gave the expelled friars the right to
return and exercise their profession.</p>
<p>To illustrate their careless procedure, I may add that they did not
even accurately determine the boundaries of the Archipelago to be
ceded, and now, in August 1900, $100,000 is to be paid to Spain for
Sibutu and Cagayan <i>Sulu</i> Islands, left out by mistake. If any man
has a right to say, &ldquo;Save me from my friends,&rdquo; that man is
William McKinley.</p>
<p>As regards Aguinaldo and the Tagals, I think that Mr. Whitelaw
Reid&rsquo;s irritation at their protracted resistance has led him on
too far. I prefer the opinion of Senator Hoar, who, speaking in the
Senate of three proclamations of Aguinaldo, said: &ldquo;Mr. President,
these are three of the greatest state papers in all history. If they
were found in our own history of our own revolutionary time we should
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>be proud to have them stand by the side of those
great state papers which Chatham declared were equal to the
masterpieces of antiquity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same speech he says, and I commend his words to the
reader&rsquo;s attention: &ldquo;Mr. President, there is one mode by
which the people of the Philippine Islands could establish the truth of
the charges as to their degradation and incapacity for self-government
which have been made by the advocates of Imperialism in this debate,
and that mode is by submitting tamely and without resistance to the
dominion of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Whitelaw Reid, however, was perfectly right in one thing. The
Philippines belong (or will belong) to America by right of conquest. On
August 28th, 1899, Mr. McKinley addressed the 10th Pennsylvania
Regiment at Pittsburgh soon after their arrival from Manila. He said:
&ldquo;The insurgents struck the first blow. They reciprocated our
kindness with cruelty, our mercy<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5019src"
href="#xd20e5019" name="xd20e5019src">5</a> with Mausers.... They
assailed our sovereignty, and there will be no useless parley until the
insurrection is suppressed and American authority acknowledged and
established. The Philippines are ours as much as Louisiana, by
purchase, or Texas, or Alaska.&rdquo; Here we get down to the bed rock,
and discard all flimsy pretences. The Americans have undertaken a war
of conquest, they bought it in fact, but I fear they are not happy
either about its material progress or its moral aspect. We shall have
to wait till November to see what they think about it.</p>
<p>But whenever the cost in lost lives, ruined health, and shattered
minds, to say nothing of dollars, comes to be known, there will be a
great outcry in America.</p>
<p>Mr. McKinley and his advisers are much to be pitied, for they were
misled by the information given them by those they relied on.</p>

<h3 class="main">The False Prophets of the Philippines.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Here is an extract from General Merritt&rsquo;s
evidence taken from the Blue Book, fifty-sixth congress, third session,
document No. 62, part <span class="sc">I</span>, p. 367:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>Mr. Reid</i>: Do you think any danger of conflict
is now reasonably remote? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href=
"#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>General Merritt</i>: I think there is no danger of conflict as
long as these people think the United States is going to take
possession there. If they imagine or hear from any source that the
Spaniards are to be reinstated there, I think they will be very
violent.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Davis</i>: Suppose the United States, by virtue of a treaty
with Spain, should take Luzon ... paying no attention to the
insurgents&mdash;how would that be taken by Aguinaldo?</p>
<p><i>General Merritt</i>: I think Aguinaldo and his immediate
following would resist it; but whether he could resist to any extent I
do not know, because his forces are divided. I believe that, as matters
go, Aguinaldo will lose more or less of his power there.</p>
<p><i>The Chairman</i>: If the United States should say, We will take
this country and govern it our own way, do you think they would submit
to it?</p>
<p><i>General Merritt</i>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Davis</i>: How many troops in your opinion will be necessary
to administer the government of this island&mdash;to secure the
administration of our government there?</p>
<p><i>General Merritt</i>: From 20,000 to 25,000 would be requisite at
first.</p>
</div>
<p>I admire the conviction of this distinguished officer that the
benefits of American rule would be highly appreciated by the Tagals, of
whom, by-the-bye, he knew next to nothing, having only been a few weeks
in Manila amongst sycophantic Mestizo-Americanistas.</p>
<p>That interesting people were, however, of a different opinion. On p.
4582 of the &lsquo;Congressional Record,&rsquo; I find that
Se&ntilde;or Mabini, in a manifesto published at San Isidro, April
15th, 1899, states that &ldquo;race hatred is much more <i>cruel and
pitiless</i> among the Anglo-Saxons&rdquo; (he is comparing them with
the Spaniards). Again he says, &ldquo;Annexation, in whatever form it
may be adopted, will unite us for ever to a nation whose manners and
customs are different from our own, a nation which <i>hates the
coloured race with a mortal hatred</i>, and from which we could never
separate ourselves except by war.&rdquo; The outbreaks against the
negroes that have recently happened [August, 1900] in New Orleans,
Liberty City, Georgia, and in New York, seem to justify Se&ntilde;or
Mabini&rsquo;s remarks.</p>
<p>Don Macario Adriatico, in an answer to a message of General Miller,
writing from Jaro, January 3rd, 1900, says: &ldquo;It could easily be
conceived that the Philippines would not suffer a new reign, least of
<i>all of a nation on whose conscience the curse of the Redskins rests
as a heavy load</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other documents they refer to the probable action of the Trusts,
and anticipate that, what with the Sugar Trust, the Tobacco Trust, and
the Hemp Trust, they would soon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122"
href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>find themselves reduced to
the condition of porters and workmen, or even of domestic servants.</p>
<p>They seem to have an intelligent anticipation of what will probably
befall them when conquered, and hence their desperate resistance to a
large American army.</p>
<p>But let us now turn up the evidence of another expert on the
Philippines, Mr. John Foreman, who also ventured to prophesy what the
Tagals would do (Blue Book, before mentioned, p. 443).</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><i>Mr. Foreman</i> (answering Mr. Day): &ldquo;The
Tagals are of a very plastic nature, willing in their nature
(<i>sic</i>), I should say, to accommodate themselves and take up any
new established dominion which might be decided upon, and I think they
would fall into any new system adopted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inhabitants of the Central Islands or Visayas are more
uncouth, decidedly less hospitable, and somewhat more averse to
associations and relations with outsiders than the Tagals, but I think
they would easily come under sway. They want a little more pressure and
would have to be guided, more closely watched, and perhaps a little
more of the iron hand used than in Luzon.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Thus was the administration in Washington misled, and it is probable
that the American military chiefs reported that they could easily
overcome all opposition, so they were allowed to try.</p>
<p>Yet in June, 1900, we read, &ldquo;The recall of General Otis is
taken to mean that the administration considers the war to be at an
end, and that there is no longer any necessity for military
rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General McArthur is appointed to the command, however, and the first
thing he does is to cable to Washington for more troops, whilst Admiral
Remey asks for an extra battalion of marines. These are to be sent,
also at least three regiments of infantry. Sixty-five thousand men and
forty ships of war are now admitted to be the proper garrison to hold
down the Philippines.</p>
<p>However necessary reinforcements may be, so deep is the racial
antipathy between the United States&rsquo; soldiers, white or black,
and the natives, that every additional man sent out is a source of
disaffection, and even exasperation. Not only will the volunteers
become demoralised and diseased in mind and body by their sojourn in
America&rsquo;s new possession, but the very fact of their presence
renders the pacification of the country more difficult. The more troops
are kept there, the more discontented the natives will be. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>To bring this chapter up to date, the position seems to be as
follows: There is a recrudescence of activity amongst the insurgents;
fighting is going on over a great part of the Archipelago, the American
troops are harassed and overworked, sickness is rife, including the
bubonic plague; yet, notwithstanding all this, the Taft Commission has
taken over the administration of the islands from September 1st.</p>
<p>The date fixed is not a convenient one for the Commission, as it is
in the middle of the rainy season, but it has probably been selected to
suit the presidential campaign in America.</p>
<p>Aguinaldo has issued a proclamation warning the Filipinos against
the Taft Commission, which, he says, has no authority from Congress;
does not represent the sentiments of the American people, and is simply
the personal instrument of Mr. McKinley sent out to make promises which
it has no power to keep, and which the United States Government will
not be bound to observe. He denounces the Americanistas, and threatens
condign punishment to all who accept offices under the Commission. It
would appear that a settlement on present lines is still some way
off.</p>
<p>Judge Taft seems to have inherited the cheerful optimism of General
Otis. On September 1st he reported that the insurrection is virtually
ended, and on 20th forwarded another favourable report. On 21st,
General McArthur cabled accounts of engagements in several provinces of
Luzon. The American troops at Pekin are being hurried to Manila, as the
reinforcement of General McArthur is absolutely imperative.

<h2 class="main">Native Admiration for America.</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="first">Their fears of a corrupt government&mdash;The islands

Brooke&mdash;Sir Andrew Clarke&mdash;Hugh Clifford&mdash;John
Nicholson&mdash;Charles Gordon&mdash;Evelyn Baring&mdash;Mistakes of

might have been&mdash;The Malay race&mdash;Senator Hoar&rsquo;s
speech&mdash;Four years&rsquo; slaughter of the Tagals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Not a few of the natives in arms were, and still are,
sincere admirers of the true greatness of the United States. The noble
deeds and words of America&rsquo;s great men attain the summit of human
grandeur in their fervid imaginations.</p>
<p>The statesmen and the historians of the great Republic receive their
tribute of praise from Filipino lips.</p>
<p>The names of Washington, Lincoln, Prescott, Motley, are known and
honoured by them. Were the natives treated according to the immortal
principles of right and justice laid down or praised by such as these,
they would welcome the tutelage, and, in fact, all Asia might envy
them.</p>
<p>But they will never consent to become the prey of the politician,
the boss, the monopolist, and the carpet-bagger, and from these they
must be assured of protection before they will submit.</p>
<p>What confidence can they have in a form of government under which
the tariffs on their great staples will be made in the interests of
their American competitors.</p>
<p>Under such a system, and with a pension list steadily growing by
millions of dollars year by year, their comfortable competence would,
in a few years, be reduced to the hideous poverty of over-taxed British
India.</p>
<p>Having passed so many years amongst this people, I may be expected
to give some opinion as to whether the Philippines can be governed by
America. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>The islands were badly governed by Spain, yet Spaniards and natives
lived together in great harmony, and I do not know where I could find a
colony in which the Europeans mixed as much socially with the natives.
Not in Java, where a native of position must dismount to salute the
humblest Dutchman. Not in British India, where the Englishwoman has now
made the gulf between British and native into a bottomless pit.</p>
<p>It will be difficult for the Americans to avoid this social
ostracism of the natives, and in this respect they are not likely to do
as well as the Spaniards, being less tolerant.</p>
<p>As regards the administration of the government, no doubt great
improvements can be made; but I abstain from prophecy, remembering
Merritt&rsquo;s and Foreman&rsquo;s want of success in that line. There
is certainly a wonderful opportunity to show the world how to govern a
tropical protectorate or dependency.</p>
<p>So rich a country with so intelligent and industrious a population
only requires good guidance to make it an earthly paradise. But the
guidance should be given by the gentle hand of an elder sister, and not
by the boot of a frontier ruffian.</p>
<p>Much as our officials praise the administration of the Indian
Empire, I think it quite possible with a few years of disinterested
tutelage to weld the Philippines into a nation, more united, freer,
happier, richer and better educated, than the finest state in that vast
possession. What is wanted is <span class="sc">The Man</span>, no
stubborn and tactless general &ldquo;spoiling for a fight,&rdquo;
harsh, peremptory, overbearing, but a civilian of the highest rank, or
a naval officer, one of America&rsquo;s very best, full of sympathy,
tact and patience, yet firm as Stonewall Jackson. He must have a
gracious presence, and &ldquo;magnetism&rdquo; in the highest degree,
for he must rule by personal influence, by inspiring confidence and
affection.</p>
<p>Not otherwise did Rajah Brooke obtain his election to the
sovereignty of Sarawak; Sir Andrew Clarke pacify the Malay Peninsula;
nor is it otherwise that Hugh Clifford is leading the Malays of North
Borneo to peaceful pursuits.</p>
<p>The man, when found, must be invested with absolute power, and be
backed up by all the forces of the Republic.</p>
<p>The British Government gave America an example of what to avoid when
it sacrificed Governor Eyre, of Jamaica, to a shrieking gang of
pseudo-philanthropists, when, in a great emergency, whilst the honour
of white women and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span>the lives of men were at the mercy of a mob
of negroes, he omitted some legal technicality before hanging one of
the cowardly instigators.</p>
<p>However, I do not think America will go back on her sons like
that.</p>
<p>Great Britain has produced some men who could have taken up the
burden of the Philippines. It happens that the three I shall cite were
all soldiers, but their extraordinary magnetic qualities by no means
proceeded from their profession.</p>
<p>The God-like man who died at Delhi, the beloved of John Lawrence,
would have made an ideal ruler: the people would have worshipped
him.</p>
<p>The hero who died at Khartoum could have ruled the Philippines, or
any Asiatic or African country, and the people would have loved
him.</p>
<p>To quote one who is still with us, Lord Cromer has coped with
difficulties of a different kind, yet, perhaps, as great as those of
the Philippines, and in a few years has changed the face of the land of
Pharaoh, and lightened the lot of millions. This has been done by the
assistance of a few engineers, administrators, judges and soldiers. He
and all of them have displayed the most unfailing tact and patience,
indomitable courage and fortitude, and each has put honour and duty
before all. Men like John Nicholson, Charles Gordon and Evelyn Baring,
are rare, but their peers doubtless exist amongst Americans of the good
old colonial stock, and it is the President&rsquo;s business to find
them, and send them out to protect and govern America&rsquo;s great
dependency.</p>
<p>America has, I suppose, taken these islands from Spain to save them
from the ruthless<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5180src" href="#xd20e5180"
name="xd20e5180src">1</a> Teuton, and to show the world that she can do
for the Philippines what we have done for Egypt. Unfortunately, she
began wrong by treating with Spain, and buying the islands, as if the
natives were cattle on a ranch.</p>
<p>Then the Peace Committee went wrong over the estates of the
Religious Orders, as before explained.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the form of government should be a protectorate,
varying in character with the civilisation of the different islands,
the executive functions being in the hands of the natives whenever
possible, but under inspection <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>to prevent abuses. On this
basis peace could, I think, be made, and then America should remember
that the most worthy of the natives are precisely those who have been
in arms for their freedom. Their chiefs (with one or two exceptions),
are the men who should be appointed to govern provinces, and the
fighting-men enrolled in the native army.</p>
<p>No offices of government should be given to the so-called
Americanistas, who are mostly people who need not be taken into
account, and whose support is worth nothing. They will go on with their
pettifogging and their pawnbroking, and that is enough reward for them.
They are Americanistas because they cannot help themselves, and not
from any attachment to American ways. Formerly the Spaniards protected
them; now the American bayonets stand between them and the Tagal
<i>bolos</i>.</p>
<p>Without this, well they know that what happened to the mulattos in
Hayti would surely happen to them sooner or later&mdash;perhaps
sooner.</p>
<p>It is, indeed, sad to see what is, and to think what might have been
accomplished by a little patience, a little forbearance, a tinge of
sympathy, for a gallant people struggling for freedom and light. But no
patience was vouchsafed to them, no forbearance was shown them, nor can
I discover in what has been done the faintest sign of sympathy for
them.</p>
<p>Yet the Malay race can claim to have enlisted the sympathies of some
not undistinguished men. Rajah Brooke, Spenser St. John, Hugh Clifford,
Professor Blumentritt, Louis Becke, Joseph Conrad&mdash;the names that
first occur to me&mdash;have all confessed to an affection for them.
The old Spanish conquerors speak of their dignified courtesy and gentle
manners.</p>
<p>There are, however, in America, generous souls who can judge the
Tagals fairly and even indulgently. I do not allude to those who raise
a clamour to discredit the administration for political purposes, but
to the noble, eloquent, and truly patriotic speech, inspired in the
best traditions of the United States, delivered by Mr. Hoar in the
Senate on April 17th. I hope that touching appeal to the national
conscience will bear fruit, and that, by the exercise of true
statesmanship, an end may be put to this dreadful war, and a
pacification effected satisfactory to Filipinos and Americans.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>For four long years, slaughter and destruction have ravaged one of
the fairest lands on earth, converting what might be a paradise into a
pandemonium.</p>
<p>What evils have these poor Tagals not suffered in that time?
Arbitrary imprisonment, torture, confiscation of property, banishment
to unhealthy places, military executions, bombardments, the storming
and burning of towns, indiscriminate slaughter, and the bubonic plague,
added to the calamities they are always exposed to&mdash;volcanic
eruptions, floods, earthquakes, typhoons, locusts, epidemics.</p>
<p>Famine seems to be the only calamity they have been free from, but
even that may not be far distant. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129"

<h3 class="main">Agricultural.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The great wealth of the Archipelago is undoubtedly to
be found in the development of its agriculture. Although the Central
and Ilocan Mountains in Luzon and parts of Mindanao are rich in gold,
it is the fertile land, the heavy rainfall and the solar heat, that
must be utilized to permanently enrich the country. The land is there
and the labour is there, and all that is wanting is capital, and a
settled government that will make roads and bridges and keep them in
repair, clear the rivers of obstructions and improve the ports, and
above all, establish and maintain some tolerable courts of justice. The
sun, the rain, the soil, and the hardy Philippine farmer will do the
rest&mdash;a population equal to that of Java could live in affluence
in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The agriculture of the Philippines at the time of the first arrival
of the Spaniards consisted mainly in the cultivation of rice. It is to
the Spaniards that the natives owe the introduction of maize, coffee,
cacao, sesame, tobacco, the indigo plant, the sweet potato, and many
fruits. They also imported horses, horned cattle, and sheep. But the
great development of the cultivation of sugar and hemp is almost
entirely due to British capital, with some assistance from
Americans.</p>
<p>The natives probably learned from the Chinese how to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>terrace the hillsides and the sloping lands, and
how to erect the <i>pil&aacute;piles</i>, or small dykes, for retaining
the rain. At that time, and for centuries after, taxes were paid in
paddy as they have been in Japan until quite recently.</p>
<p>Under the heading &ldquo;Tagals,&rdquo; a description is given of
the planting of paddy, and an illustration shows the aspect of a
newly-planted paddy-field or tubigan. Mountain rice-lands are called
bacores or dalatanes. The cutting and harvesting of paddy is paid for
in kind, sometimes in Camarines Sur, a third of the crop is given for
getting it in, but in the province of Manila it is cultivated in equal
shares to the farmer and the owner of the land.</p>
<p>By looking at the illustration it will be seen that, the fields
being divided into such small patches of irregular shapes at different
levels, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to use a
reaping-machine. I have elsewhere given the reasons for my opinion that
the cultivation of rice is the lowest use that the land and the
husbandmen can be put to, and whenever the cultivation is given up, it
is probably an indication that the cultivators are raising some more
profitable crop, and earning money by exporting valuable produce,
wherewith to import rice from countries in a lower stage of
civilisation.</p>
<p>This is most certainly the case in the Philippines, and year by
year, as the exports of hemp, sugar and tobacco have increased, the
imports of rice from Saigon and Rangoon have risen correspondingly. And
yet the United States&rsquo; Department of Agriculture, issued in the
latter part of 1899 a circular with the title,&rsquo;Plant Products of
the Philippines,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e5239src" href=
"#xd20e5239" name="xd20e5239src">1</a> which, amongst other inaccurate
appreciations, says: &ldquo;It seems strange that an almost exclusively
agricultural country should not produce enough food for its own
population, but such is at present the case with regard to the
Philippines.&rdquo; It proceeds to say that in some years the value of
rice imported into Manila from Saigon was valued at $2,000,000. But I
would point out to the author of that circular that the export of the
three great staples of the Philippines in those years averaged,
perhaps, $30,000,000, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href=
"#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>and this, evidently, could not
have been accomplished if they had cultivated their own rice.</p>
<p>The Spaniards sometimes raised this same groundless clamour, and,
perhaps, the author of the circular took it from them; but I look upon
it as a great mistake arising from insufficient knowledge of the
subject. The rice imported into Manila is largely shipped to the
tobacco and hemp provinces, Cagayan and Albay, where the people are
exclusively employed in the cultivation and preparation of those
valuable products, and are far richer, and on a higher grade of
civilisation than the rice-growers of Cochin China.</p>
<p>In the Philippines themselves, the people of the rice-growing
districts are the poorest and most backward of all.</p>
<p>Besides paddy, the natives cultivate the dava or m&iacute;jo
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Panicum miliaceum</i>), the mongo, a species of
lentil (<i lang="la-x-bio">Phaseolus mungo</i>), called in some
provinces balat or balatong, for their own consumption.</p>
<p>When rice is dear, they mix a certain amount of maize with it, and
when it is really scarce they eat the seeds of the sorghum (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Holcus saccharatus</i>) instead of it. They also make an
infusion of these seeds, which is not unlike barley-water. The camote
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Impom&oelig;a batata</i>) is the principal food of
the more uncivilised tribes.</p>
<p>All the natives find a great resource in the banana, which the
Tagals called saguin. The following varieties are excellent: Bungulan,
Lacatan, Ternate, and Tindoc.</p>
<p>Wheat was formerly grown in northern Luzon. The late Archbishop of
Manila, Fray Pedro Payo, informed me that, when he was a parish priest
years ago, he always ate bread made from Philippine flour, which he
thought far better and safer than the Californian flour that had
superseded it.</p>
<p>Tobacco is an important crop in the Philippines, and from the year
1781 was cultivated in Cagayan as a government monopoly. In the
villages of that province the people were called out by beat of drum
and marched to the fields under the gobernadorcillo and principales,
who were responsible for the careful ploughing, planting, weeding, and
tending, the work being overlooked by Spanish officials. Premiums were
paid to these and to the gobernadorcillos, and fines or floggings were
administered in default. The native officials carried canes, which they
freely applied to those who shirked their work.</p>
<p>In another part of the book I have referred to the series
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>of abuses committed under the monopoly: how the
wretched cultivators had to bribe the officials in charge of the scales
to allow them the true weight, and the one who classified the leaves,
so that he should not reject them as rubbish and order them to be
destroyed; in fact, they had to tip every official in whose power it
was to do them any injustice. Finally, they received orders on the
treasury for the value of their tobacco, which were not paid for
months, or, perhaps, for years. They sometimes had to sell their orders
for 50 percent of the face value, or even less.</p>
<p>However, even the Spanish official conscience can be aroused, and at
the end of 1882 the monopoly was abolished.</p>
<p>Here it is only right to honourably mention a Spanish gentleman to
whom the natives of the Cagayan Valley in a great measure owe their
freedom. Don Jose Jimenez Agius was Intendente General de Hacienda, and
he laboured for years to bring about this reform, impressed with the
cruelty and injustice of this worst form of slavery. The Cagayanes were
prohibited from growing rice, but were allowed as an indulgence to
plant a row or two of maize around their carefully tilled
tobacco-fields.</p>
<p>Possibly this circumstance has led the author of the circular I have
before quoted to make the extraordinary statement: &ldquo;Tobacco, as a
cultivated crop, is generally grown in the same field as maize.&rdquo;
Does he think it grows wild anywhere?</p>
<p>In 1883, the &ldquo;Compa&ntilde;ia General de Tabacos de
Filipinas&rdquo; was established in the islands, the capital being
raised in Paris and Barcelona.</p>
<p>This Company has been under very capable management; the technical
department being overlooked by M. Armand Villemer, a French engineer of
great ability and experience. The Company has done a great deal to
improve the cultivation of the plant and the preparation of the leaf.
They run light draught paddle-steamers and barges on the Cagayan River,
and sea-going screw-steamers from Aparri to Manila.</p>
<p>Their estates are mentioned under the heading
&ldquo;Cagayanes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides the Cagayan Valley, the following Provinces produce tobacco
in considerable quantities.</p>
<p>In Luzon, the Ilocos North and South, Abra, Union, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>Nueva Ecija. Also Masbate, Ticao, and most of
the Visayas Islands. The Igorrote also raise a considerable
quantity.</p>
<p>The quantity of tobacco and cigars exported since 1888 is given in
the Appendix; and, seeing the enormous extent of land still available
in the Cagayan Valley, there can be no doubt that the production can be
very largely increased as the demand grows.</p>
<p>The export of leaf tobacco from Manila, the only shipping port, has
increased from 204,592 quintals in 1888, to 287,161 quintals in 1897,
and during the same period the export of cigars has increased from
109,109 mil to 171,410 mil.</p>
<p>The cultivation of the <i>Musa textilis</i> is almost a monopoly of
the Philippines, and, indeed, of certain parts of them.</p>
<p>Volcanic soil, a certain elevation above the sea, and exposure to
the breezes of the Pacific, a bright sun and an ample rainfall, seem
necessary to the production of a fine quality of this fibre.</p>
<p>Several attempts have been made to produce this fibre elsewhere; the
Government of British India sent a gentleman to Manila to study the
question. He wrote a report, but I have never heard that any
abac&aacute; was produced.</p>
<p>The plant was said to grow wild all along the Sarawak rivers; but
here again some mistake must have been made, for nothing seems to have
come of it.</p>
<p>There is, in fact, nothing so far to compete with it, and there is
an immense and growing market. The price has lately fluctuated
enormously, and I do not intend to prophesy what profits might be made
in planting it.</p>
<p>In 1897, no less than 915,338 bales were exported, about 114,400
tons, and if we take the average price at that time as $15 per bale, we
get a sum of over $13,730,000 as the value of that year&rsquo;s export,
the largest in quantity, but not in value.</p>
<p>The export of hemp has been almost entirely developed by British and
American enterprise, and dates from very recent times.</p>
<p>The spread of the sugar-cane cultivation in the Philippines from the
year 1870 was rapid, and is in great measure due to the advances made
by British and American houses to the planters. It was for many years a
most profitable business, and this is proved by the large and handsome
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>houses of the planters in the towns of the sugar
districts. The continual increase of the beet sugar production, however
brought down prices to such an extent as to reduce the profits below
the heavy interest paid on loans or advances. But it seems now that
bottom has been reached, and that rising prices and more economical
methods of financing and of manufacturing will give the planters a
fresh start. Those who know what has been and is being done by central
sugar factories in Cuba, will not doubt the possibility of doing better
in the Philippines, where labour is cheaper and is on the spot.</p>
<p>Under the headings Pampangos, Pangasinanes, and Visayas, will be
found many interesting particulars of the working of sugar plantations
in these provinces.</p>
<p>In 1893, the export of sugar amounted to 260,000 tons; since then it
has declined, but in 1897 it still amounted to close on 200,000
tons<span class="corr" id="xd20e5324" title="Source: ,">.</span></p>
<p>The export of coffee has almost entirely ceased, and the cause is
ascribed to the ravages of an insect which destroys the bushes. Lipa,
in Batangas province, was the great coffee centre, and became one of
the richest towns in Luzon. Notwithstanding this prosperity, the
plantations were never cultivated with proper care. Weeding was much
neglected. In 1888, the export reached 107,236 piculs, but in 1897 it
had fallen to 2111 piculs.</p>
<p>There is an opening for coffee-planting on many of the elevated
plateaux of the islands, and capital with skill ought to find its
reward.</p>
<p>The Moros of Lake Lanao export a certain quantity of coffee of
indifferent appearance but excellent flavour.</p>
<p>Cacao grows well in many parts of the Archipelago, but I have never
seen any large plantations of it. A few trees may be seen in the
gardens of old houses, but they must be protected from insects and
rats, and require looking after.</p>
<p>The quantity raised in the islands is not sufficient to supply the
home demand, so that cacao beans are imported from Venezuela and
chocolate from Spain.</p>
<p>It is a risky business to plant cacao in the northern Philippines;
the trees are delicate and suffer from the typhoons. And the produce is
so valuable that, unless watched at night or protected in some way, the
cones may when nearly ripe be carried away by thieves.</p>
<p>In Palawan, where the typhoons do not ravage, I have seen cacao
trees 30 feet high, with an abundant crop. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>The plant from which indigo is elaborated was cultivated in former
years to a considerable extent in some provinces, notably the Ilocos,
but the export trade was destroyed by the adulterations of the
Chinese.</p>
<p>In 1895, 6672 quintals were exported from Manila, but only 462
quintals in 1896. Ten specimens of Ilocos indigo were shown at the
Madrid Exhibition of 1887, and the price varied from $12 to $67 per
quintal.</p>
<p>For home use the dye is sold in a liquid form, contained in large
earthen jars called tinajas. It is known as <i>Tintarron</i>.</p>
<p>Sesame and other oil-giving seeds are cultivated to a small extent
in several provinces, but neither the seed nor the oil figure in the
list of exports.</p>
<p>The cocoa-nut palm grows in most of the lowlands of the Philippines,
except in the North of Luzon. In suitable soil it grows to the very
edge of the sea, as in the Cuyos Islands, In the provinces of Laguna
and Tayabas there are large numbers of these trees and a lively
business is carried on in making oil from nuts or in sending them to
Manila for the market or for shipment.</p>
<p>When large quantities are to be sent, they are formed into rafts in
a very ingenious manner, each nut being attached by a strip of its own
fibre without any rope being required.</p>
<p>These rafts are sometimes a hundred feet long and ten or twelve feet
wide, and are navigated across the lake and down the Pasig. Finally
they are brought alongside a steamer, the nuts are cut adrift and
thrown into the hold through the cargo ports.</p>
<p>The nuts that are to be used for making oil are stripped of their
husks and cut in halves. They then pass to a workman who is provided
with an apparatus called a <i>Cutcuran</i>. This is mounted upon a
trestle and consists of a revolving shaft of hard polished wood,
carrying on its overhanging end an iron disc about three inches in
diameter having teeth like the rowel of a spur.</p>
<p>This is set edgeways in a slot in the shaft. On each side of the
trestle near the ground is a treadle; from one of these a cotton cord
passes over the shaft taking a round turn and is made fast to the other
treadle. The operator sits astride the trestle with a foot on each
treadle. By working them alternately he produces a rapid revolution of
the shaft in alternate directions, and the cutting disc being
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>double-edged it cuts both ways. By holding a
half nut against the revolving cutter he in a few seconds rasps out
every particle of the nut which falls upon a tray in fine shreds.</p>
<p>The shredded material is then heated in a cast-iron pan over a slow
fire, and whilst hot is filled into bags of strong material which are
placed in the press.</p>
<p>This is constructed entirely of hard wood, and the pressure is
obtained by driving wedges with a heavy mallet.</p>
<p>The system is primitive, but all the apparatus is practical and very
cheap.</p>
<p>D. Carlos Almeida of Bi&ntilde;an stated to me in 1890 that 400
large cocoa-nuts gave by this process one tinaja or jar of oil,
equivalent to 10&frac12; English gallons, which was then worth on the
spot six Mexican dollars. It is sold in Manila. At this time cocoa-nuts
were sold in Santa Cruz, the capital of the Laguna, for about $15 per
thousand. The oil cake was used either to feed pigs or as a manure
about the roots of coffee-plants. The owner of cocoa-palm groves in
Luzon or Visayas lives in anxiety during several months of each year,
for should the vortex of a typhoon pass over or near his plantation, a
large proportion of his trees may be destroyed.</p>
<p>The true locality for such plantations is in the southern and
western parts of Mindanao and Palawan, to the south of a line drawn
from the northern point of Mindanao to Busu&aacute;nga Island in the
Calamianes, preferring the most sheltered spots.</p>
<p>In this region the danger from typhoons is inconsiderable, and the
trees flourish exceedingly. I have been shown trees in bearing at
Puerta Princesa which I was assured were only three years old. I saw
older trees bearing immense bunches of nuts, too many to count, and it
seemed wonderful to see a slender trunk bearing aloft sixty feet in the
air so heavy a load. From fifty to one hundred trees can be planted on
an acre according to the space allowed to each, and when in full
bearing after six or seven years each tree might give eighty nuts in a
year. The crop goes on all the year round.</p>
<p>Copra is prepared from the nuts either by drying the whole nut under
cover in the shade, allowing the water to become absorbed and then
breaking up the kernel for bagging, or else by breaking it up first of
all and drying it in the sun. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137"
href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the first case a large airy shed is required, and the process
takes three months. In the latter case three days of sunshine will
suffice, but the kernels must be protected from the dew at night and
from any chance shower of rain. Artificial heat does not produce good
copra, and besides is expensive to apply.</p>
<p>Making copra is one of the most paying enterprises in the
Philippines, but it requires capital to be laid out several years
beforehand, unless a plantation can be bought to start with.</p>
<p>Previous to 1890, the quantity of copra exported was so small that
no record was kept of it. In that year 74,447 piculs were exported, and
the trade has gone up by leaps and bounds, so that in 1897 no less than
811,440 piculs were sent out, over fifty thousand tons.</p>
<p>The present position of agriculture seems to be that there are in
the Philippines somewhere about six millions of civilised Christian
people tilling eight million acres of land, and exporting some thirty
million dollars&rsquo; worth of produce each year. They also raise a
large quantity of food-stuffs for their own consumption, but import
perhaps a couple of million dollars&rsquo; worth of rice because it is
cheaper to buy it than to grow it, as we in England import wheat for
the same reason. The area of land under cultivation is computed at
one-ninth of the total area of the islands.</p>
<p>The author of the circular <i>Plant Products of the Philippines</i>,
to which I have before referred, makes the following remarks: &ldquo;In
view of the natural fertility of the soil and the vast extent of these
rich lands not yet under cultivation, it is safely assumed that the
total agricultural production of the islands could be increased
tenfold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This gentleman seems to be of a sanguine disposition, and he reminds
me rather of Oscar F. Williams&rsquo; cheerful optimism. But in one way
he is more cautious than that gentleman. He does not fix a time for his
prophecy to be accomplished.</p>
<p>I would point out, however, that in the seventy-five million acres
comprised in the islands there are volcanic cones, peaks of basalt,
stony plains, unexplored regions, swamps and other undesirable
localities for establishing farms or plantations, and that some of the
good lands are held by warlike tribes who would resent any intrusion
into their domains.</p>
<p>There are, it is true, great tracts of land in Mindanao <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>and
Palawan, and no doubt in time they will come under cultivation.</p>
<p>Taking everything into consideration, I hold to my view that with
peace, honest government and a good Vagrancy law, the export of produce
might be doubled in twenty years if capital is forthcoming in
sufficient amount. The land is worth nothing without the husbandmen,
and it will take the Philippines a long time to recover from the
devastating effects of the insurrection of 1896&ndash;7 and the
American war of subjugation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the three and a quarter centuries the Spaniards
have held the Philippines, the forests of Luzon have supplied enormous
quantities of the finest timber for building houses, churches,
convents, bridges, warships, lighters and canoes. No care has ever been
taken to replant, and the consequence is that at this day long logs of
many kinds most wanted are not obtainable, all the large trees of
valuable timber have long ago been cut, and only in the most distant
and least accessible places are any worth having to be found.</p>
<p>The greatest nonsense is talked about the value of the Philippine
forests, but in fact it is only in the fever-stricken Island of
Mindoro, and in certain parts of Palawan and Mindanao, that any large
and valuable trees can be found.</p>
<p>Labour is a great difficulty; wood-cutters are scarce, and they are
a wild, unruly lot; only men inured to such a rough life can resist the
malaria of the woods, and even they are occasionally down with
fever.</p>
<p>Chinamen would not venture into the forests, and only the natives of
each district are available, as they do not care to go far from their
houses. In order to engage them it is necessary to make them advances
of money which it will seldom be possible to recover. A good deal of
tact is required in dealing with the cutters, they are very independent
and will not put up with abuse. A considerable capital is required to
give advances to, and feed these men, also for buying buffaloes, which
die unless good care is taken of them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>If a cutter can be found who has buffaloes of his own, it is better
to hire them with him, as then they are sure to be taken care of.</p>
<p>The dragging the large logs to a river or port can only be done by
teams of buffaloes. The conditions prevailing prevent the employment of
chutes, wire ropes and winding engines, or tram-lines.</p>
<p>The valuable trees do not grow together in numbers as in the forests
of California and Oregon, but are found at considerable distances from
each other. It is therefore only possible to commence the use of
mechanical conveyance at the spot where the logs can be assembled by
animal labour. Even so, the number of logs from any district will be so
small that it will hardly pay to lay down a tramway.</p>
<p>The logs are squared in the woods and the butt ends are rounded like
the runners of a sleigh, two holes are chopped at the top corners with
a small adze called a palacol, through which rattans are passed for the
buffaloes to be yoked to. They are then dragged down to the river or
sea. The wood is too heavy to float, and bundles of bamboos are
attached to it to give it buoyancy.</p>
<p>The idea of putting up saw-mills in the forests is absurd&mdash;for
the reason given above.</p>
<p>The wood is very hard and tough, and specially made machinery is
required to work it.</p>
<p>The framing must be heavier, the feed lighter, and the teeth of the
saws much smaller and with less set. I have had some excellent
machinery and saws specially made in England for this purpose, by
Thomas Robinson &amp; Son of Rochdale, but I sent home logs of the
woods required to be worked, for the saws, planers, and moulding
cutters to be made to suit. The ordinary sawing machinery as shown in
trade catalogues would be of no use at all.</p>
<p>The whole business is extremely risky, it requires a manager, immune
to jungle fever, a man of great vigour yet patient and tactful. Such a
man, understanding the native ways, would probably succeed after years
of hard and dangerous work; but I warn any one thinking of taking up
this business that in Luzon valuable trees are few and far between, and
distant from port or river, whilst in other islands where there are
timber trees they stand there because no one could ever be induced to
go and cut them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141"
name="pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>As for exporting these timbers to the United States or other places,
there is no need to do that, for demand for timber in Manila and other
towns is greater than the supply, and iron construction is increasing
in consequence.</p>
<p>Oregon or Norway pine is of no use for building purposes in the
Philippines, for it would be devoured within a year or two by the
<i lang="tl">anay</i> (white ants). I am told, however, that in spite
of warnings the United States military authorities have constructed
stables and storehouses of this timber.</p>
<p>I think it quite useless to mention the names of the different
Philippine timbers, as those who take an interest in them can purchase
the &lsquo;Manual de Maderero&rsquo; (Wood-cutters&rsquo; Manual) and
obtain all the information they require from it.</p>
<p>Molave is the most important, being proof against the white ants,
and almost imperishable. Ypil and yacal are splendid woods for large
roofs. They can be obtained long enough for tie-beams, even for wide
spans, and excellent roof-frames can be made by bolting them
together.</p>
<p>On the Zambales mountains and in Benguet and Lepanto there are
forests of conifer&aelig;. When the Manila-Dagupan Railway was being
built, I had some sample sleepers brought down from thence. They were
quite suitable, but could only be used if thoroughly creosoted, as
otherwise they would merely provide food for the white ants. As there
are no gasworks in the Islands, creosote could not be produced, nor
would it pay to import it from Hong Kong or elsewhere on account of the
freight and duties.</p>
<p>There is no market in the islands for pine and no one cuts the
trees. They are not of great size. The Igorrotes burn them to clear the
land for planting.</p>
<p>True ebony is not found in the forests, but a very handsome and
heavy wood, called Camagon, is the nearest approach to it, being
dark-brown nearly black, streaked with bright yellow. It is found of
larger size than ebony and is sold by the pound.</p>
<p>Teak has often been reported to exist and samples of the alleged
teak have been shown to me. On comparing them with teak from Rangoon a
considerable difference was noted and the characteristic odour was
absent. My own impression is that there is no teak in the Philippines.
I have paid two dollars a cubic foot for teak in Manila and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>if there was any to be had, this price would, I
think, have fetched it out.</p>
<p>As for such jungle produce as gum-damar, canes, and rattans, if the
reader will refer to my remarks on Palawan he will see that the most
valuable products are mostly worked out, and that in any case this is
not white man&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>There is, however, one branch that, in view of increasing scarcity
and rising price, should be carefully looked after by the Philippine
Administration; I refer to the collection of gutta-percha in Mindanao.
This caused quite a boom for a short time, but as usual the Chinamen
got hold of the stuff and mixed it with various kinds of rubbish, so
that it was soon discredited in the European market.</p>
<p>An official of high-standing might be appointed to the double office
of Protector of the Natives, and Conservator of the Forests in
Mindanao, and rules for collecting the gutta without destroying the
trees should be prepared and enforced by personal visits from the
conservator and his deputies, to whom all the gutta should be handed,
being paid for in cash. This would probably yield a large revenue to
the Government and greatly benefit the natives, for they might receive
half the value of the gutta instead of the minute fraction the Chinese
now give them.</p>
<p>The reader who has perused the previous remarks will no longer be
liable to be caught by tales of the fabulous riches of the Philippine
forests. And, above all, he should keep clear of any companies that may
be formed to exploit them. Energetic and tactful individuals may
succeed, but the success will be due to personal qualities, and will be
contemporaneous with that gifted party and disappear with him. This is
what happened to the &ldquo;Laguimanoc Saw Mills and Timber
Company&rdquo; as soon as the founder left.</p>
<p>A large proportion of the jungle produce of Mindanao, Palawan, and
the smaller Southern Islands is smuggled away by the Chinese traders to
Sandakan or Singapore.</p>
<p>All that appears in the Table of Exports is two or three hundred
tons of gum copal shipped each year from Manila. <span class=

of the subject have been published. Amongst the authors are the mining
engineers, Don Enrique Abella and Don Jos&eacute; Centeno. But some of
their most important reports are still in manuscript, for the revenues
of the Philippines were almost entirely absorbed in paying the salaries
of the officials, and there was a great disinclination to spend money
in any other way.</p>
<p>At the Philippine Exhibition, held at Madrid in 1887, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>more
than seven hundred specimens of auriferous earths or sand, gold quartz,
and ores of various metals were shown, and in this branch alone there
were 109 exhibitors from all parts of the Archipelago.</p>
<p>Besides ores there were the tools and utensils used by the miners,
and models of the furnaces and forges in which the metals were reduced
and worked, with the metals in different stages of concentration or
manufacture, and a complete show of the finished products.</p>
<p>A great many Mining Companies have been formed in Spain or in Manila
at different times which have all failed from a variety of causes, want
of skill, bad management, costly administration, or because the
richness of the vein or seam had been exaggerated.</p>
<p>The difficulty of getting labour is considerable, as mining is a
work the generality of natives do not care to take up, although in some
provinces they are used to it, for example, in Camarines Norte and in
Surigao.</p>
<p>Employers seem to forget that the ordinary food of a native, rice
and fish, is not sufficiently nourishing to enable him to do hard and
continuous work, such as is required in mining. A higher rate of pay
than the current wage is essential, to allow the miner to supply
himself with an ample ration of beef or pork, coffee and sugar, and
provision should be made for him to be comfortably housed.</p>
<p>In this complaint of want of labour it is not always the native who
is to blame, and if a mine cannot afford to pay a reasonable price for
labour, it had better stand idle.</p>
<p>Probably the one great reason why mines have not prospered in the
Philippines is that there has never been slavery there, as in Cuba,
Peru, Mexico, Brazil, ancient Egypt, and other great mining countries,
where whole populations have been used up to minister to the avarice of
their fellow-men.</p>

<h3 class="main">Gold.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From my remarks upon the other minerals it will be
seen that I have no illusions on the immediate prospects of working
them.</p>
<p>With gold, however, it is different. For centuries large quantities
have been collected or extracted, mostly, no doubt, from placers, still
some rich veins are known to exist.</p>
<p>The early writers agree that gold is plentiful. Dampier says:
&ldquo;Most, if not all, the Philippine Islands are rich in
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of the Batanes Islanders, he says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;They have no sort of coin, but they have small
crumbs of the metal before described&rdquo; (he seemed at first to
doubt whether it was gold), which they bind up very safe in plantain
leaves or the like. This metal they exchange for what they want, giving
a small quantity of it&mdash;about two or three grains&mdash;for a jar
of drink that would hold five or six gallons. They have no scales, but
give it by guess.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In the &lsquo;Relacion de las Islas Filipinas,&rsquo; 1595(?), the
author remarks that the Tagals &ldquo;like to put on many ornaments of
gold, which they have in great abundance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farther on, he says of Luzon:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The people of this island are very clever in
knowing&rdquo; (valuing) &ldquo;gold, and they weigh it with the
greatest subtleness and delicacy which has ever been seen; the first
thing they teach their children is to know gold and the weights used
for it, for amongst them there is no other money.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Farther on, he says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Ilocos ... has much gold, for the principal
mines of these islands are in the mountain ranges of this province, of
which they get the advantage, for they trade with the miners more than
any people. The Spaniards have many times endeavoured to people the
mines so as to work them, but it has not been possible up to the
present, although the Governor, Gonzalo Ronquillo, took the greatest
pains, and it cost him many men, the country being so rough and
destitute of provisions.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In Pigafetta&rsquo;s &lsquo;Voyage Round the World&rsquo;
(Pinkerton), Vol. ii., p. 333, we read that at Caraga (Mindanao) a man
offered an ingot of massive gold for six strings of glass beads.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span></p>
<p>On p. 331, he says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The king who accompanied us informed us that
gold was found in his island in lumps as large as walnuts, and even as
an egg, mingled with earth; that they used a sieve for sifting it, and
that all his vessels, and even many of the ornaments of his house were
of this metal.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>On p. 348, he says that he saw many utensils of gold in the house of
the Raja or King of Butuan.</p>
<p>On p. 349, we find the following remarks:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;What most abounds is gold. Valleys were pointed
out to me in which by signs they made me comprehend there were more
lumps of gold than we had hair on our heads, but that, for the want of
iron, the mines exact greater labour to work them than they feel
inclined to bestow.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Coming down to later days, Thomas de Comyn, 1810, writes:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Gold abounds in Luzon and in many of these
islands; but as the mountains which contain it are in the power of
pagan Indians, the veins are not worked, nor even the mines known.
These savages collect it from placers or streams, and bring it as dust
to the Christians who inhabit the plains, in exchange for coarse cloth
or fire-arms, and at times they have brought it in grains of one or two
ounces&rsquo; weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the general opinion that this class of mines abound in
the province of Caraga, situated on the east of the great island of
Mindanao, and that there, as well as at various other points, gold is
found of 22 carat fine.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He states that the Royal Fifth, or rather Tenth (for it was found
the mines could not pay a fifth, and it was reduced by half), in the
year 1809 amounted to $1144. This would represent an extraction of gold
equal to only $11,440; but this was probably but a small part of the
whole, as from the circumstances of the case the gold dust from the
washings would be surreptitiously disposed of, and only the few mines
that were worked, paid the tax. I had occasion, about <span class=
"corr" id="xd20e5653" title="Source: twevle">twelve</span> years ago,
to make inquiry how much gold was raised in Camarines Norte, and a
person well-informed on the subject estimated it at a value of $30,000
gold dollars.</p>
<p>Gold is certainly very widely distributed in the islands. I have
seen women washing the sands of the River San Jos&eacute; del Puray in
the province of Manila, and noted what small specks they collected. I
was informed that their average earnings were about 25 cents per day.
Whether <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>these sands could be dredged and washed
mechanically on a large scale with profit I cannot say.</p>
<p>In 1890, I ascended the Puray River and went up the Arroyo
Macaburabod to where it bifurcates. There, close to the boundary of the
province of Manila and district of Moron, I found a face of
disintegrated quartz glittering with large crystals of iron
pyrites.</p>
<p>This was near a geological frontier where the igneous and
sedimentary rocks joined, and the neighbourhood was highly mineralized,
there being iron, coal, and gold within a short distance. I took a
large number of samples, and the analyst Anacleto del Rosario declared
that one of them gave an assay of 17 dwts. of gold to the ton. But of
course such assays prove nothing, for the accidental presence of a
grain of gold in the sample would make all the difference in the
results.</p>
<p>Near Gapan in Nueva &Eacute;cija more profitable washings are
situated, and at times large numbers of men and women are to be seen at
work, especially after a sudden flood has come down. The sands of the
River Agno also yield gold, and the washing for it is quite an industry
amongst the Pangasinan women about Rosales, but the return is said to
be small. But after a north-westerly gale has heaped up the black sand
at the mouth of this river in the Bay of Lingayen, the people turn out
in numbers to wash it, and sometimes have better luck. But although
these washings are poor, a considerable quantity of gold is obtained
from the Igorrotes, and there is no doubt that these people have for
centuries worked quartz veins or pockets, and that they only extract
sufficient for their modest requirements in the way of purchasing
cattle, cloth, and tools. They do not hoard any gold, for they say that
it is safer in the mine than in their houses. When one of them requires
a few ounces he goes to his mine, gets it out, and immediately proceeds
to purchase what he wants. Possibly they do not consider the supply
inexhaustible, and they have thought for to-morrow, or for those who
will come after them. It is not their object to exhaust the bounties of
nature in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>When they have found a rich pocket they build a house over the pit,
and when not at work they cover the hole with roughly-hewn planks or
logs ; they take precautions in disposing of the detritus, so that it
does not call attention from a distance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the Exhibition of 1887 the Comandante Politico-Militar of the
Province of Benguet showed samples of auriferous quartz from Antaniac
and from Capunga, also quartz with visible threads of gold from the
latter place, also leaf gold from the veins, two specimens of
auriferous quartz from Pangutantan with gold extracted from it, and
gold-dust from the River Agno.</p>
<p>Other exhibits included specimens of gold-bearing rock from Lepanto
and Infantas, and compact auriferous quartz from the celebrated
gold-pits of Suyuc near Mancayan. All these quartz reefs are worked by
the Igorrotes.</p>
<p>Gold is also found near Atimonan in Tayabas, but the neighbourhood
of Paracale and Mambulao, and the slopes of Mount Labo are most famous
in Manila.</p>
<p>During the last century large quantities of gold were taken from the
surface-workings, which are now exhausted, or only afford a miserable
living to the natives who treat the auriferous earths in a very
primitive way.</p>
<p>The gold having been taken, the next thing was to use the reputation
of the mines to attract capital, and this was done to some considerable
extent, one company being founded on the ruins of another. One of the
later ones was the &ldquo;Ancla de Oro,&rdquo; or Golden Anchor, but
its capital was expended without results. The late Don Antonio
Enriquez, a Spanish gentleman well-known to British and Americans in
Manila, worked some mining properties there for some years, and had
faith in them.</p>
<p>He consulted me about them, and I forwarded some samples of the ores
to my agents in London, who had them analyzed by Messrs. Johnson &amp;
Matthey, but the results were not encouraging, and did not confirm the
analysis made in Manila.</p>
<p>About 1890, Messrs. Peele, Hubbell &amp; Co. got out an American
mining expert, whose name I forget, but I believe he was a mining
engineer of high standing. He spent some time at Mambulao and Paracale,
and made a careful examination of the country. It was understood that
his report did not encourage any further expenditure in prospecting or
development. But of late years further attempts have been made to boom
the place, and the Mambulao Gold Mining Syndicate, London, 1893, has
been formed. I am unaware on what new information the promoters rely to
justify their bringing this place again before the public. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p>Surigao, in the old kingdom of Caraga, is rich in gold which is very
widely disseminated. Father Llovera, a missionary who, in March, 1892,
made an excursion up the River Siga to visit some unbaptized
Maman&uacute;as in the mountains, declares that the sands contain much
gold, so much so that particles were plainly visible. This river takes
its rise in the eastern Cordillera, between Cantilan and Jabonga, and
runs in a north-easterly direction into the southern part of Lake
Mainit. The missionary also declares that veins of gold were visible in
some of the pieces of rock lying in the bed of the river, which they
broke to examine. But he does not seem to have brought back any
specimens, as one would expect.</p>
<p>His declaration is confirmed by Dr. Montano, a French traveller and
skilled explorer, who however does not say that he saw the gold dust
amongst the sand.</p>
<p>From Surigao to Gigaquil the people are engaged in washing the sands
for gold.</p>
<p>Foreman states that for many months remittances of four or five
pounds weight of gold were sent from Mindanao to a firm in Manila, and
that it was alluvial gold from Surigao extracted by the natives.</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; Centeno, Inspector of Mines, says in a report:
&ldquo;The most important workings effected in Surigao are in the
Caninon-Binutong and Cansostral mountains, a day&rsquo;s journey from
the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These mountains consist of slaty talc much metamorphosed, and
of serpentine. In the first are found veins of calcite and quartz from
half-an-inch to three inches thick, in which especially in the calcite
the gold is visible mixed with iron and copper pyrites, galena and
blende. It is a remarkable circumstance that the most mineralized veins
run always in an east and west direction, whilst the poor and sterile
veins always follow another direction. The workings are entirely on the
surface, as the abundance of water which flows to them prevents sinking
shafts, and nothing is known of the richness at depth. Rich and sterile
parts alternate, the gold being mostly in pockets. From one of the
veins in Caninoro in a length of eighteen inches <i>one hundred ounces
of gold</i> were taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time after this find, Messrs. Aldecoa &amp; Co., a Manila firm,
erected stamps at Surigao, and a certain amount of gold was sent up by
every steamer to Manila, but in spite of the apparently favourable
circumstances, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>the enterprise was ultimately abandoned and the
machinery removed.</p>
<p>I do not know the reason, but people in Manila are so used to the
collapse of mining companies that it is regarded as their natural and
inevitable end, and no explanations are required.</p>
<p>Nieto (p. 75) mentions the northern parts of the province of Surigao
and Misamis as the richest in gold. In Misamis there is both alluvial
gold and rich quartz reefs, the richest known spots being Pighoulugan
on the River Cagayan, Iponan and Pigtao. The ore at the latter place is
auriferous iron pyrites, called by the natives Inga.</p>
<p>Nuggets weighing from two and a half to four ounces have been found
in these places, so that Pigafetta&rsquo;s stories are not without
foundation.</p>
<p>On March 20th, 1888, a clerk of Don Louis G&eacute;nu, a merchant in
Manila, called upon me on business and exhibited a large pickle bottle
full of gold which he had just received from Cagayan de Misamis. There
were several pounds weight of it, and I carefully examined it with a
lens. I found it in pieces, many of them half an inch or more in
length, slightly flattened, and having minute particles of white quartz
adhering to them, and a few loose particles of quartz. The pieces were
not water-worn, and had evidently formed part of a seam of dendritic or
lace gold, such as I had seen exhibited by a vendor of mining
properties in Denver, Col., just a year before.</p>
<p>This exhibit opened my eyes to the possibilities of gold mining in
Mindanao, but I did not leave my business to go prospecting.</p>
<p>The natives of this part of Mindanao look upon washing for gold as
their chief resource. A certain quantity of what they collect is used
to make ornaments, and passes from hand to hand instead of coin in
payment of gambling debts, and stakes lost at cockfights. The Mestizos
and Chinamen get hold of the rest and send it away surreptitiously, so
that no statistics can be collected. It is impossible to tax gold
collected in this way, but the Government might derive a profit by
establishing posts in each district where gold would be purchased at a
fixed price and so get, say, ten or twenty per cent. out of it instead
of allowing the Chinese and Mestizos to make perhaps forty or fifty per
cent. according to the ignorance of the vendor.</p>

<p>Foreman is probably quite right in saying that the influence of the
friars has always been exerted against any mining company, whether
Spanish or foreign. They did not want a rush of miners and Jews to the
Philippines. But now, under the American Government, their power must
decline, and new undertakings will, in a measure, be free from this
hindrance.</p>
<p>The Spanish mining laws and regulations are excellent and a perfect
model for legislation on the subject. They are based on the principle
that the ownership of the surface gives no title to the minerals
underneath, which belong to the State. The owner can, however, obtain a
title by developing a mine.</p>
<p>The ingenuity and unscrupulousness of that vile breed, the native
<i>Pica-Pleito</i> or pettifogging lawyer, has greatly contributed to
stop Europeans from proceeding with mining enterprises, as success
would bring down these blackmailers in swarms.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the new government will lay a heavy hand on
these birds of prey. Rightly considered, they are only a species of
vermin, and should have verminous treatment.</p>
<p>Now that the fortune of war has handed over the sovereignty of the
Philippines to an enterprising and energetic race, I cannot doubt that
the mystery of centuries will be dispelled.</p>
<p>Amongst the Californian, Colorado, or Nevada volunteers, there
should be men having the courage, the knowledge of prospecting, and the
physical strength necessary for success in this quest, if they can
obtain permission from their superiors to attempt it. The prospects are
so good that they should not have any difficulty in getting capitalists
to finance them.</p>
<p>They will require to go in a strong party to prevent being cut off
by the savages, and to escort their supplies of provisions.</p>
<p>As deer and wild pig abound they will be able to supply themselves
in a great measure with meat by sending out a couple of good shots to
hunt.</p>
<p>For such as these gold mining ought to be most remunerative, and
enable those who survive the many perils to retire with a fortune after
a few years of hard work. But so far as I know there is not at present
sufficient information about any mines in the Philippines, whether of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>gold or any other metal, to warrant the
establishment of companies for purchasing and working them.</p>
<p>Mining claims can be staked out and registered under the present
laws by natives or foreigners, but in limited areas, and placers or
river beds can be worked by all without leave or license, and cannot be
monopolised.</p>
<p>I wish to avoid prophesy, but I shall be much surprised if the
Philippines, in American hands, do not turn out in a few years an
important gold-producing country.</p>

<h3 class="main">Copper.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Native copper has been found in several places in the
islands, amongst them are Surigao and Torrijos in Mindoro.</p>
<p>In the article on the Igorrotes, I have spoken of the copper mines
of Mancayan, and related how, when worked by the savages they were
successful to the extent of supplying themselves with cooking-pots,
trays and ornaments, besides leaving an annual surplus of about
nineteen tons of copper, which was sold.</p>
<p>A Spanish company obtained the concession about 1864, and drove out
the natives.</p>
<p>The title was the Sociedad Minera de Mancayan, and they experienced
considerable difficulties in getting a merchantable product, their
science being at a disadvantage compared to the practical knowledge of
the Igorrotes. They, however, persevered, and got up to a make of about
180 tons in one year&mdash;nearly ten times the production obtained by
the Igorrotes. But the usual fate of Philippine mining companies
overtook them, and the works were closed in 1875, it was said from
scarcity of labour.</p>
<p>Several kinds of ores are found at Mancayan, almost on the surface,
red, black and grey copper, also sulphates and carbonates of
copper.</p>
<p>About Mambulao cupro-ferruginous quartz and copper pyrites are
found, but are not worked.</p>
<p>I am quite unable to venture any opinion on the prospects of
copper-mining and smelting in the Philippines, but no doubt experts
will shortly obtain the necessary data to decide what can be done, but
capital should be laid out with great caution, and the many
difficulties of climate, carriage and labour taken into consideration.

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Iron.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is plenty of iron ore in the Philippines. In
Luzon it occurs plentifully in the western spurs of the Cordillera all
the way from Bosoboso to San Miguel de Mayumo, and it is now worked
near the latter place in a primitive way. Plough-shares, cooking-pots
and <i>bolos</i> are the principal productions; the fuel used in all
cases is charcoal. I sent to the Philippine Exhibition of 1887 at
Madrid a dozen <i>bolos</i> made from native iron. The ore is very
rich, giving 70 to 80 per cent. of iron; when polished it is of a
beautiful silvery white colour, very tough, and of the finest quality.
Attempts have been made by Europeans to work the iron ores of Luzon,
but they have invariably ended in the bankruptcy of the adventurers,
and in one case even in suicide.</p>
<p>When deer-shooting at the Hacienda de San Ysidro above Bosoboso many
years ago, I learned from the natives there that in the next valley,
not far from the hamlet of Santa Ines, there existed the remains of
some old iron-works, abandoned years ago. They said there were
unfinished forgings still lying about, amongst them two anchors. I did
not, however, go to examine them, being intent on shooting.</p>
<p>Red hematite is found in Ceb&uacute;, brown hematite in Paracale and
other parts of Camarines Norte, and both red and brown in Capiz. In
Misamis oxydized iron is found. Some of the iron about San Miguel de
Mayumo is magnetic.</p>
<p>I do not believe that at present, and for many years to come, it is
possible to work these ores and make iron and steel to compete with
American or British imported iron.</p>
<p>But the time may come when, under different conditions, these
remarkable ores may be turned to account; in fact, it is asserted a
scarcity of high class iron ore will soon occur, in which case the
Philippine ores of such extraordinary richness will come into use.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Coal.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is common to see coal mentioned amongst the mineral
resources of the Philippines, but so far as I have been able to learn,
no true coal has been found there, nor in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>any of the adjacent
islands. There are beds of lignite of varying quality, and when
enthusiastic finders are told of the poor quality of their samples,
they reply at once, &ldquo;It will be better at depth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Philippine formations seem to greatly resemble those of Borneo,
and there it was found that the lignite got poorer at depth, so that
mines were abandoned from this cause alone.</p>
<p>The Philippine beds of lignite have been violently upheaved by the
cataclysms of former ages, and are often turned up vertically, as at
the mines of Sugud in Albay. I was consulted about these mines after a
considerable sum had been thrown away. The Spanish engineer employed
commenced by building himself a commodious house; he then laid a
tramway from the port to where the mine was to be, and bought a winding
engine. The available capital was expended, and nothing more was
done.</p>
<p>The position of the seams at Sugud very much resembles the
occurrence of the seams at the Pengaron mine in Borneo, which stopped
work 18th October, 1884, after a precarious existence of thirty-six
years, on account of the poor quality of the coal and the relatively
high cost of extraction. This is on the authority of Dr. Theodor
Posewitz in &lsquo;Borneo: its Geology and Mineral Resources,&rsquo;
1892, and what follows so exactly applies to all the so-called coal in
the Philippines, that I shall quote the paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">P. 480.&mdash;&ldquo;A number of analyses were carried
out, and practical tests were applied on board various ships. The
result was always ore or less favourable, yet nobody would have the
coal.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The coal mine in the British Colony of Labuan was given up after
several years&rsquo; working.</p>
<p>People blame the Spanish Government, the priests, the natives, the
roads, but the reason of failure in the Philippines is very simple.
&ldquo;Nobody would have the coal,&rdquo; that is to say on board ship.
The lignite could be used on land, but there is little demand for it,
except for navigation. Some of it is liable to spontaneous combustion
in the bunkers, some is so charged with sulphur as to be bad for the
furnaces, or else it will not keep steam. I doubt if there is any good
coal between Japan and Australia, and as long as coal from there can be
delivered at present prices in Manila, I don&rsquo;t advise anybody to
put money <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>into Philippine coal unless they know more about
it than I do.</p>
<p>It has often been said that the Philippines have never been
explored. This is, however, only true of certain regions, and as
regards beds of the so-called coal you will find them marked on the
maps all over the principal islands.</p>
<p>If you proceed to the village nearest the spot, you will find, very
probably, that the seam has been known for a century, and that pits or
adits have been made and a lot of money spent to no purpose. Nobody
ever made any money out of Philippine lignite that I know of, but I
don&rsquo;t prophesy whether anybody ever will.</p>
<p>I append an analysis of some so-called coal that was brought me from
Masbate in 1889.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Lead.</i>&mdash;Galena is found in Tayabas and in
Camarines Norte; in the latter province there is found chromate of lead
with ferruginous quartz. This ore is often found mixed with iron or
copper pyrites, and sometimes with blende.</p>
<p>I have seen samples of galena from Ceb&uacute; which was said to be
auriferous, but I have never heard that any of these ores have been
worked anywhere in the islands.</p>
<p>If it should be found profitable to smelt the gold-bearing ores, as
is so splendidly done at Denver, Col., the galena will be necessary to
the success of the process.</p>
<p><i>Red Lead</i> is found in Camarines Norte and other places.</p>
<p><i>Graphite.</i>&mdash;In 1891 some pieces of this valuable mineral
were shown to me by a native, who said he had found the ore in Mindoro,
but he would not say from what locality.</p>
<p><i>Quicksilver.</i>&mdash;I have seen small bottles of this handed
round by native disciples of Ananias. But I have never seen a bit of
cinnabar or other ore of mercury, and I shall not believe there is any
of this metal in the Philippines until I see the ore <i>in situ</i>, or
have good testimony to that effect.</p>
<p><i>Sulphur</i> abounds; there are several places where it can be
obtained in large quantities near the volcanoes.</p>
<p><i>Asbestos.</i>&mdash;This curious mineral would not strike a
native as being of value.</p>
<p>All I can say about it is that at the Madrid Exhibition of 1887 a
specimen of this substance was shown by the Civil Governor of Ilocos
Norte as having been found in that province.</p>
<p><i>Yellow Ochre</i> is found in Batangas, Camarines, Albay, Leyte
and Antique, amongst other places.</p>
<p><i>Kaol&iacute;n</i> is found in Manila, Batangas and Camarines Sur,
and probably in many other places.</p>
<p><i>Marble</i> of a yellowish colour has been quarried at Montalban.
I have used some of it, but found it full of faults, and not very
satisfactory.</p>
<p><i>Plastic Clays</i> for pottery and for making bricks and tiles
abound.</p>
<p><i>Mineral Waters.</i>&mdash;As might be expected in a volcanic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>region, hot springs and mineral waters of very
varied constituents abound.</p>
<p>I do not think that the analyses of these would interest the general
reader.</p>
<p>I may say that I have derived great benefit from the hot-springs of
Los Ba&ntilde;os on the lake, and greatly regretted that I could not
remain at the extraordinary vapour baths of Tibi near Tabaco.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The manufactures of the Philippines, such as they are,
have been mentioned when describing the different tribes or peoples and
only a summary is necessary here.</p>
<p>The making of cigars and cigarettes employs probably 30,000 people
in the Province of Manila, the vast majority being women. But the best
cigars are made by men who have been trained under skilled operatives
brought from Havana.</p>
<p>A vast improvement has taken place since the Government monopoly has
been abolished, and now the Manila cigars are as well-made and are put
up in as tastefully decorated boxes as the Havanas.</p>
<p>Cigarettes are now largely made by machines; the Compa&ntilde;ia de
Tabacos de Filipinas having rows of them in their factories.</p>
<p>Textiles are made in hand-looms all over the Archipelago by the
women in their spare time.</p>
<div class="figure xd20e6037width" id="p158"><img src="images/p158.jpg"
alt="Group of women making Cigars." width="720" height="513">
<p class="figureHead">Group of women making Cigars.</p>
<p class="first xd20e1984"><i>To face p. 158.</i></p>
</div>
<p>But in certain Provinces large numbers of women are regularly
employed at the loom-working for those who make a business of it. In
Ilocos and Union very excellent coverlets, sheets, serviettes,
handkerchiefs and towels are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href=
"#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>woven from cotton, as well as the
fabrics called abac&aacute;, j&uacute;si or rengue, nipis, saguran,
sinamay and guingon. This last is very suitable for military or naval
uniforms; it is a blue cotton cloth similar to what sailors call
dungaree.</p>
<p>In some of the towns of Pampanga and Bulacan, notably in
Bali&uacute;ag where the people are specially clever and industrious,
excellent silk handkerchiefs are woven. In Camarines and Albay the
fabrics of abac&aacute; are more commonly woven, and in Ceb&uacute; the
women are accustomed to work at the loom.</p>
<p>But it is from Ilo-ilo and neighbourhood that a very large trade is
done with the other islands in many kinds of textiles. There also the
Visayas work industriously at it as a trade and produce most beautiful
fabrics of pi&ntilde;a, silk, cotton, and abac&aacute;, as well as the
cheaper sorts for the use of the working classes. In some of the mixed
materials a beautiful effect is produced by running stripes of silk,
either white or of the most brilliant colours, lengthways through the
piece. I have sent some of these j&uacute;si dress fabrics to ladies in
England and they have been greatly appreciated when made up by a
<i lang="fr">bonne faiseuse</i>.</p>
<p>They are very suitable for wearing in the Philippines or elsewhere
in the tropics, being light and gauzy. This material, as well as some
of the other fine gauzy fabrics, takes a long time to make in a
hand-loom, the advance is imperceptible. I should like to put some of
the calumniators of the Filipinos to work a hand-loom and make a
dress-length of j&uacute;si. I think every one would recant before he
had made a yard.</p>
<p>At the Philippine Exhibition of 1887 there were more than three
hundred exhibitors of textiles, and one of them, the Local Board of
Namaypacan in the Province of Union, showed one hundred and forty-five
different kinds of cloths.</p>
<p>There are several rope-works at Manila and the material used is
abac&aacute;, the ropes produced are equal to any to be had
anywhere.</p>
<p>In Camarines Sur both harness and hammocks are made from this
material.</p>
<p>In the Provinces ropes are made of cabo-negro, a black fibre from
the wild palm, said to be indestructible; of bur&iacute;, of fibre from
the anab&oacute;, of the bark of the lapuit, and of rattan. Bayones or
sacks for sugar, est&eacute;ras or sleeping mats, hats and cigar cases,
and baskets of all sorts, are made at different places and from the
commonest up to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span>very finest. That called the Tampipi is now
regularly kept in stock in London, and is very handy for
travelling.</p>
<p>There is a lager beer brewery in Manila that must have piled up
money since the American garrison arrived.</p>
<p>Alcohol is distilled both from sugar and from the juice of the
nipa-palm (<i lang="la-x-bio">Nipa fructicans</i>).</p>
<p>The oils and resins of Ilocos have been mentioned when describing
the Ilocanos; they are not exported, finding a ready market in the
country.</p>
<p>Essence of Ylang-ylang is distilled in Manila and other towns; it
used to fetch formerly 1000 francs per kilogramme.</p>
<p>Salt is made at many places between Para&ntilde;aque and Cavite.</p>
<p>Bricks, tiles, cooking pots [bangas], stoves [calanes], sugar moulds
[pilones], and draining pots for the pilones [ollas], are made in many
provinces.</p>
<p>The industry of the women is also shown by the very beautiful
embroideries of all sorts, either in white or coloured silks or in gold
or silver. Some of this latter work, however, is done by men.</p>
<p>In some cases they introduce seed-pearls or brilliant fish-scales in
their work. The slippers worn by the women on grand occasions are often
works of art, being richly embroidered in silver and gold on cherry
coloured velvet.</p>
<p>Some notable pieces of goldsmiths&rsquo; and silversmiths&rsquo;
work have been done in Manila, and in the provinces some of the natives
carve bolo handles and other articles out of buffalo horn and mount
them in silver with much taste.</p>
<p>The salacots, or native hats, are beautifully woven by hand from
narrow strips of a cane called nito [lygodium], and the headmen have
them ornamented with many pieces of repouss&eacute; silver (<i>see</i>
Illustration).</p>
<p>Cocoa-nut oil is expressed in the province of the Laguna, in Manila
and other places. Soap of the ordinary kind is manufactured from
it.</p>
<p>Saddles and harness are made in all the leading towns, and the
ordinary country vehicle, the carromata, is made in the chief towns of
provinces and some others; but some of the components, such as the
springs, and axle-arms and boxes are imported. But in Manila really
elegant carriages are constructed, the leather for the hoods, the cloth
for the linings, the lamps, as well as a good deal of the ironwork,
being, however imported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=

<p>In former years large frigates have been built, armed, and fitted
out at Cavite and other ports, but at present the ship-building
industry is in decadence, and the shipwrights capable of directing so
important a job have died out. The increasing scarcity and high price
of timber is now a difficulty, and sailing vessels are in little
demand. Small steamers and launches are now built, but larger steamers
are ordered from Hong Kong or Singapore, or, in case of vessels well
able to make the passage, the order goes to England.</p>
<p>The native craft called lorchas, pailebotes, pontines, barotos,
paraos, cascos, guil&aacute;los, barangayanes, bangcas, vintas and
salisipanes are still built in large numbers. The last are very light
and fast craft used by the Moros on their piratical expeditions.</p>
<p>Engines and boilers for steam launches are made in Manila, church
bells are cast of a considerable size; iron castings are also made.</p>
<p>Amongst the miscellaneous articles manufactured are all sorts of
household furniture, fireworks and lanterns. Dentists, painters,
sculptors and photographers all practise their trades.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Filipinos have learnt a certain amount
from the Spaniards as regards their manufactures; but, on careful
consideration, I think they have learnt more from the Chinese. Their
first sugar-mills were Chinese and had granite rollers, and from them
they learnt the trick that many a moulder might not know, of casting
their sugar-pans in a red-hot mould and cooling slowly and so getting
the metal extremely thin yet free from defects. The casting of brass
cannon and of church bells has been learnt from them, and doubtless
they taught the Igorrotes how to reduce the copper ores and to refine
that metal. Again, the breeding of fish, an important business near
Manila, and the manufacture of salt round about Bacoor comes from them.
I am not sure whether the hand-loom in general use is of the Chinese
pattern, but I think so.</p>
<p>Distilling the nipa juice is certainly a Chinese industry, as also
the preparation of sugar for export. This is done in establishments
called <i>farderias</i>, and is necessary for all sugar made in
<i>pilones</i> or moulds. The procedure is described under the head of
Pampangos, and an illustration is given of the process of drying the
sugar on mats in the sun. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href=
"#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>Many native men and women and numbers of Chinese coolies are
employed in Manila, Ilo-ilo, and Ceb&uacute; in preparing produce for
shipment.</p>
<p>The hemp used to come up from the provinces loose or merely twisted
into rolls to be pressed into bales at the shipping ports, but of late
years several presses have been erected at the hemp ports in Southern
Luzon and on the smaller islands.</p>
<p>There are a number of hemp-presses in Manila, each requiring about
sixty coolies to work it, and one or two clerks to attend to the
sorting and weighing.</p>
<p>They were paid so much per bale pressed.</p>
<p>Steam, or hydraulic presses, would long ago have been substituted
but for the fact that the clerks or <i>personeros</i> were each allowed
one or two <i>deadheads</i> on the pay list, and this was so profitable
to them that they strongly opposed any changes, and none of the
merchants cared to take the risk of the innovations.</p>
<p>Two presses were set in line, astride a pair of flat rails, a small
one called the Bito-bito for the first pressure on the pile of hemp,
and the large one to squeeze down the bale to its proper size.</p>
<p>They were simply screw presses having hardwood frames set deep into
massive stone foundations and surrounded by a granite pavement.</p>
<p>A pair of these presses, <i>i.e.</i>, a Bito-bito and a press
erected in Manila under my direction in 1888, cost $4400, the woodwork
foundation and pavement costing $2850, and the screws, nuts,
capstan-heads, etc., costing $1550. The small press had a screw 4
inches diameter and 6 feet long, and was worked by two or four men. The
large press had a screw 8&frac14; inches diameter, and 12 feet
long.</p>
<p>Both screws worked in deep gun-metal nuts and had capstan-heads.
When the large press was near the end of its travel the capstan bars
were manned by forty coolies putting out their utmost strength and
shouting to encourage each other as they tramped round on the upper
floor keeping step.</p>
<p>The turn out was about 250 bales from daylight to dark. Each bale
weighed 2 piculs, say 280 lbs., or eight to the English ton. The bales
should measure 10 cubic feet, that is a density of 28 lbs. per cubic
foot. The hemp could be pressed into a smaller volume, but it is
asserted that the fibre would be seriously damaged. Sometimes from
careless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>pressing the bales measure 12 cubic feet. They
swell after leaving the press and after being moved.</p>
<p>At the date I have mentioned, the charge for screwage was 50 cents
per picul, but it has been raised since then.</p>
<p>Dry sugar was exported in its original bags, and loading and
shipping cost 12&frac12; cents per picul. Wet sugar usually required
repacking for export, and the charge for discharging the coaster and
rebagging was 17&frac12; cents per picul, as well as 12&frac12; cents
for loading and shipping.</p>
<p>It lost 2&frac12; per cent. in weight in repacking and 10 per cent.
during the voyage in sailing vessel to Europe or America. So that
altogether one-eighth of the total was lost to the shipper, and there
was a good perquisite to the skipper or mate in pumping the molasses
out of the bilges.</p>
<p>The repacking was usually done by natives, and the old mat bags
scraped by women who receive half the sugar they save. The mats are
sold to the distillers and are thrown into their fermenting vats, to
assist in the manufacture of pure Glenlivat or Bourbon whisky, Jamaica
rum or Hollands gin.</p>
<p>In 1891 I saw on board a steamer just arrived from Antwerp hundreds
of cases containing empty gin bottles packed in juniper husk, the
labels and capsules bearing the marks of genuine Hollands.</p>
<p>They were consigned to one of the Manila distillers, and must have
enabled that respectable firm to make a large profit by selling their
cheap spirit as imported liquor.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the manufactures and industries of the Philippines are
in a primitive condition, but the tax called the <i lang=
"es">Contribucion Industrial</i> has discouraged improvements, for as
soon as any improved machinery or apparatus was adopted, the
tax-gatherer came down upon the works for an increased tax. Thus any
sort of works employing a steam-engine would be charged at a higher
rate. This tax, if it cannot be abolished, should be reformed.</p>
<p>There is a great future before the manufactures of the Philippines,
for the people are industrious, exceptionally intelligent, painstaking
and of an artistic temperament, so that an ample supply of labour is
always available for any light work if reasonably remunerated. They
will not need much teaching, and only require tactful treatment to make
most satisfactory operatives. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The commercial prospects of the Islands are great,
even if we do not instantly take for gospel the fairy tales we are told
about Manila becoming the centre of the trade of the Pacific. There can
be no doubt that if peace and an honest administration can be secured,
capital will be attracted and considerable increase in the export of
hemp, tobacco, and sugar will gradually take place as fresh land can be
cleared and planted. As I have elsewhere said, the Philippines in
energetic and skilful hands will soon yield up the store of gold which
the poor Spaniards have been so mercilessly abused for leaving behind
them. But the Philippines are not and never will be a country for the
poor white man.</p>
<p>A white man cannot labour there without great danger to his health.
He cannot compete with the native or Chinese mechanic, in fact he is
not wanted there at all. For my part, I would never employ a white man
there as a labourer or mechanic, if I could help it, more especially an
Englishman or an American, for I know from experience what the result
would be. As foreman or overseer a white man may be better, according
to his skill and character. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href=

<p>If long occupation or possession on the part of our government be
considered, I believe early and strenuous efforts should be made to
bring here from the United States men and women of many
occupations&mdash;mechanics, teachers, ministers, ship-builders,
merchants, electricians, plumbers, druggists, doctors, dentists,
carriage and harness makers, stenographers, type-writers,
photographers, tailors, blacksmiths, and agents for exporting, and to
introduce American products natural and artificial of many classes. To
all such I pledge every aid, and now is the time to start. Good
government will be easier the greater the influx of Americans.</p>
<p>My despatches have referred to our present percentage of export
trade. If now our exports come here as intestate, duty free, we have
practical control of Philippine trade, which now amounts to many
millions, and because of ingrafting of American energy and methods upon
the fabulous natural and productive wealth of these islands, can and
probably will be multiplied by twenty during the coming twenty years.

other.</p>

<p>I hope for an influx this year of 10,000 ambitious Americans, and

<p class="signed">(Signed) <span class="sc">O. F. Williams</span>,<br>
<i>Consul</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>I venture to say that the man who wrote this astonishing letter,
taking upon himself the responsibility of advising &ldquo;early and
strenuous efforts&rdquo; to send from the United States thousands of
men and women of many occupations to Manila, and of assuring them that
&ldquo;all could live well and become enriched,&rdquo; knew nothing at
all about the state of the Philippine Islands, and is a most unsafe
guide.</p>
<p>What on earth would all these tradespeople find to do in the
Islands? Where could they be housed? How could they be supported? If
they came in numbers, the doctors and druggists might indeed find full
employment prescribing and making up medicine for the many sufferers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>from tropical ailments, especially the typhoid
fevers, that would attack the unacclimatised immigrants and the
ministers could earn their daily bread by reading the Burial Service,
whilst the type-writers would be busy typing letters to friends at home
announcing the deaths that occurred; and warning them against coming to
starve in Manila. But I defy any one to explain how the ship-builders,
electricians, plumbers, tailors and blacksmiths are to make a living.
As regards merchants or agents for exporting, I may say that Americans
have not been very successful in Manila in this capacity. The great and
influential firm of Russell &amp; Sturgis came to grief through
over-trading, and another noteworthy firm, Messrs. Peele, Hubbell &amp;
Co. failed from rash speculations in sugar, and not from any
persecutions by the Spanish authorities, as has been falsely stated in
a magazine article. I speak with knowledge on the matter, as I was well
acquainted with this firm, having been their Consulting Engineer for
the construction of the Slipway at Ca&ntilde;acao for which they were
agents. I think it only right to say that the gentlemen who were heads
of these American firms were worthy upholders of the high reputation of
their country. They failed, but no imputations rested on the characters
of the partners, and I have always heard them spoken of with great
respect, especially amongst the natives.</p>
<p>Those of them who were personally known to me were men who
invariably showed every courtesy and consideration to all who came in
contact with them, whether Europeans or natives. Notwithstanding their
misfortunes they were a credit to their country, and they did a good
deal towards the development of the trade of the Philippines.</p>
<p>I believe that the estates of Russell &amp; Sturgis when realised,
paid all their liabilities in full, and besides left considerable
pickings in the hands of the liquidators and their friends. Two or
three firms were built up out of their ruins. Some Chinese half-castes
and natives had received heavy advances from this firm, especially
about Molo and Yloilo. One well-known individual had received $60,000,
and when summoned before the court he claimed the benefit of the
&lsquo;Laws of the Indies,&rsquo; by which his liability was limited to
$5. The judge, however, ordered him to repay the principal <i>at the
rate of a dollar a month</i>! I had this information from the judge
himself.</p>

</div>
<p>Curiously enough, American merchants have been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>equally unsuccessful in other parts of the Far
East. Many will remember the failure of Messrs. Oliphant &amp; Co., the
great China merchants, agents for the American Board of
Missions,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6275src" href="#xd20e6275" name=
"xd20e6275src">1</a> notwithstanding their desperate effort to retrieve
their position by reviving the coolie trade with Per&uacute;, and in
later days Messrs. Russell &amp; Co. of Hong Kong also came to
grief.</p>
<p>I can give no explanation of the reasons for these four great
failures, but I conjecture that all these firms were in too much of a
hurry, and tried to &ldquo;hustle the East.&rdquo; Yet in face of this
calamitous experience, Oscar F. Williams advises more to come,
&ldquo;pledges every aid,&rdquo; and predicts that &ldquo;trade can,
and probably will, be multiplied by twenty during the coming twenty
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For my part, I should think it great progress if the exports and
imports of the Philippines could be doubled in twenty years. The idea
of sending plumbers to Manila where lead pipes are not used, is a
comicality only matched by the suggestion that tailors are wanted
amongst a population dressed in cotton shirts and trousers, and where
the white people wear veranda-made white duck suits.</p>
<p>Both notions are more suitable for a comic opera than for an
official document.</p>
<p>There is only one more paragraph in this letter that I need comment
on.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams says: &ldquo;Good government will be easier, the
greater the influx of Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To those who know the East there is no necessity to argue on this
point. I therefore state dogmatically that the presence of white
settlers or working people in the Islands would add enormously to the
difficulties of government. This is my experience, and during the
Spanish Administration it was generally admitted to be the case.</p>
<p>In British India the Government does not in the least degree favour
the immigration of British workmen. The only people who are recognised
as useful to that country are capitalists and directors of Agricultural
or Industrial enterprises.</p>
<p>A large number of American mechanics turned loose amongst the
population would infallibly, by their contempt for native customs, and
their disregard of native feeling, become an everlasting source of
strife and vexation. Impartial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168"
href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>justice between the parties
would be unattainable; the whites would not submit to be judged by a
native magistrate, and the result would be a war of races.</p>
<p>It may be taken as probable that there is no crime, however heinous,
that could be committed by an American upon a native, that would
involve the execution of the death penalty on the criminal.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e6298src" href="#xd20e6298" name="xd20e6298src">2</a>
On the other hand, I can quite believe that natives laying their hands
upon Americans, whatever the provocation, would be promptly hanged, if
they were not shot down upon the spot. The natives, it should be
remembered, are revengeful, and will bide their time; either to use the
bolo upon one who has offended them, to burn down his house, set fire
to his crop, or put a crow-bar in amongst his machinery. I fear that
American brusqueness and impatience would often lead to these savage
reprisals.</p>
<p>I think, therefore, that the American Administration of the
Philippines should be empowered to prevent or regulate the immigration
of impecunious Americans or Europeans whose presence in the Islands
must be extremely prejudicial to the much-desired pacification. No, the
poor white is not wanted in the Islands, he would be a curse, and a
residence there would be a curse to him. He would decay morally,
mentally, and physically. The gorgeous East not only deteriorates the
liver, but where a white man lives long amongst natives, he suffers a
gradual but complete break-up of the nervous system. This peculiarity
manifests itself amongst the natives of the Far East in the curious
nervous disorder which is called mali-mali in the Philippines and
sakit-latah amongst the Malays of the Peninsula and Java. It seems to
be a weakening of the will, and on being startled, the sufferer
entirely loses self-control and imitates the movements of any person
who attracts his attention. It is more prevalent amongst women than
men. I remember being at a performance of Chiarini&rsquo;s Circus in
Manila, when General Weyler and his wife were present. The clown walked
into the ring on his hands, and a skinny old woman amongst the
spectators who suffered from the mali-mali at once began to imitate him
with unpleasing results, and had to be forcibly restrained by the
scandalised bystanders.</p>

<p>Running <i>amok</i> marks a climax of nerve disturbance, when the
sufferer, instead of committing suicide, prefers to die killing
others.</p>
<p>He usually obtains his wish, and is killed without compunction, like
a mad dog.</p>
<p>Both natives and white residents are at times in rather a low
condition of health, and if after exercise or labour they fail to get
their meal at the proper time, when it comes they cannot eat. In its
lighter form this is called <i>desg&aacute;na</i> or loss of appetite,
but I have seen natives collapse under such circumstances with severe
headache and chills. This more serious form is known as <i>traspaso de
hambre</i>, and is sometimes the precursor of fever and nervous
prostration.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church has had the wisdom to recognise and make
allowance for the liability of residents and natives of the Philippines
to this serious disorder, and has relaxed the usual rules of fasting,
as being dangerous to health.</p>
<p>Amongst the Europeans who have been long in the Islands, many are
said to be &ldquo;chiflado,&rdquo; a term I can only render into
English by the slang word <i>cracked</i>. This occurs more particularly
amongst those who have been isolated amongst the natives.</p>
<p>It is not easy to account for, but the fact is undeniable. I have
heard it ascribed to &ldquo;telluric influence,&rdquo; but that is a
wide and vague expression. Perhaps the explanation may be found in the
extreme violence of the phenomena of nature.</p>
<p>The frequent earthquakes, the almost continuous vibration of the
soil, the awe-inspiring volcanic eruptions, with their sooty black
palls of ash darkening the sky for days together, over hundreds of
miles, the frightful detonations,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e6341src"
href="#xd20e6341" name="xd20e6341src">3</a> the ear-splitting thunder,
the devastating rage of the typhoons, the saturated atmosphere of the
rainy season, and the hot dry winds of Lent, with the inevitable
conflagrations, combine with depressing surroundings and anxieties to
wreck the nerves of all but the strongest and most determined natures.
If to all this the white resident or sojourner in the Philippines adds
the detestable vice of intemperance, or even indulges in a liberal
consumption <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>of spirits, then instead of merely shattering
his nerves, he is likely to become a raving maniac, for it takes much
less whisky to bring on delirium tremens there, than it does in a
temperate climate.</p>
<p>Long sojourn in some other lands appears to act in a different
manner. In tropical Africa it seems to be the moral balance that is
lost. The conscience is blunted if not destroyed, the veneer of
civilisation is stripped off, the white man reverts to savagery. The
senseless cruelties of Peters, Lothaire, Voulet, Chanoine, and of some
of the outlying officials of the Congo Free State are not mere
coincidences. They must be ascribed to one common cause, and that is
debasement by environment. The moral nature of a white man seems to
become contaminated by long isolation amongst savages as surely as the
physical health by living amongst lepers.</p>
<p>If a poor white man wishes to sink to the level of a native, he has
only to marry a native woman, and his object will be fully attained in
a few years. But he will find it very much to his pecuniary interest,
for she will buy cheaper and sell dearer than he can, and will manage
his house and his business too, most economically. Some of her
relations will come and live with him, so that he will not feel lonely,
and a half-caste family will grow up round about him, talking the
dialect of their mother, which he, perhaps, does not understand. But if
the poor white man takes out a white wife, he will probably have the
pain and distress of seeing her fade away under the severity of the
climate, which his means do not permit him to alleviate. White women
suffer from the heat far more than men. Children cannot be properly
brought up there after the age of twelve. They must either be sent home
to be educated, or allowed to deteriorate and grow up inferior to their
parents in health, strength, and moral fibre. When I think of these
things, I feel amazed at Oscar F. Williams&rsquo; presumption in
writing that letter. I hope that not many have taken his advice, and
that any who have will call on him to fulfil his imprudent pledges.</p>
<p>However, now I have done with the poor white man. Capital is the
great necessity of the Philippines. The labour is there if Generals
Otis and McArthur have left any natives alive.</p>
<p>More banks are wanted. At present there are three important banks in
Manila, and two of them have branches <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>in Yloilo. The Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has the largest resources; next
comes the Chartered Bank of India, Australasia, and China, and lastly
the Banco Espa&ntilde;ol Filipino. The first two give the most perfect
facilities for business. I was only interested in importing, but
certainly nothing more could be desired by an importer than their
system of opening credits against shipping documents; for practically
he only had to pay for the goods when they arrived in Manila. All their
business was done in the most expeditious manner, and I could suggest
no improvement on their methods.</p>
<p>The Banco Espa&ntilde;ol Filipino was in a measure under government
control, its procedure was consequently very slow, and its ways those
of bygone days.</p>
<p>These banks, however, did not advance money to cultivators to clear
lands, plant crops, or erect machinery, as the returns are too slow,
not to say doubtful. Yet this is what is wanted; banks in Manila and
the chief towns that will advance money for such purposes, under the
advice of experts personally acquainted with the cultivators and their
lands. Such a business certainly requires great intelligence and
discernment.</p>
<p>Still there is a future for such banks, for agriculturists have to
pay enormous rates of interest and commissions for money to carry on
their plantations. Such banks could also finance timber-cutters, gold
miners, and other <i>bona fide</i> workers.</p>
<p>Amongst the enterprises I have recommended when writing about the
Pampangos, and others engaged in planting sugar-cane, is the
establishment of central sugar factories in suitable localities. Such
undertakings, judiciously administered, would have every prospect of
success.</p>
<p>There is also room for paper-mills, rice-mills, cotton-mills, and
saw-mills, but all these, especially the last, need careful
consideration for the selection of the locality where they are to be
placed. The manufacture of various kinds of leather could be greatly
extended and improved. There is employment for more coasting steamers
and schooners. The latter and hulls of small steamers can be built in
the country from the native timber.</p>
<p>Although the development of means of communication is all-important,
it is evident from the configuration of the Archipelago that no great
length of railway is required, nor would it pay to construct them in so
mountainous a country. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href=
"#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>Water-carriage is all-important.
In Luzon a line of railway might be made from Manila to Batangas with a
branch into the Laguna province. It would traverse a fertile and
thickly-populated country.</p>
<p>A short line of railway or electric tramway from near Siniloan on
the Lake to the Pacific would be most useful in giving access to and
developing the eastern coast, or contra costa, as it is called. This
coast is very backward in every way, indeed from Baler to Punta
Escarpada on its extreme north, it is quite unknown, and remains in the
possession of the Dumagas, an aboriginal tribe of heathen savages of
low type, just as at the time of the Spanish conquest; and it would be
worth while to study the question of cutting a ship-canal through this
narrow strip of land if the mouth could be protected from the Pacific
surf. There is also Bishop Gainza&rsquo;s project that might be
revived, that of cutting a canal for country craft from Pasacao in
Camarines Sur to the River Vicol. In Negros and Panay some short lines
from the ports through the sugar lands might pay if constructed very
economically.</p>
<p>Tramways between populous towns not far apart in Luzon and Panay
would probably pay very well, as the people are fond of visiting their
friends.</p>
<p>It will probably be many years before Mindanao will be in a position
to warrant the construction of railways. The island has relapsed into
barbarism as a consequence of the withdrawal of the Spanish garrisons
and detachments, and of nearly all the Jesuit missionaries.</p>
<p>It could, however, give employment to a flotilla of small steamers
and sailing vessels on its northern and southern coasts.</p>
<p>Such is my opinion in brief upon the possibilities of the
development of industries and commerce.</p>
<p>That the commerce of the islands, now mainly British, will
ultimately pass into American hands, can scarcely be doubted. They are
not yet firmly seated in power, but their attitude to British and
foreign firms is already sufficiently pronounced to allow an observant
onlooker to make a forecast of what it will be later on.</p>
<p>Dominating Cuba, holding the Philippines, the Sandwich Islands and
Porto Rico, the Americans will control the cane sugar trade, the
tobacco trade, and the hemp trade, in addition to the vast branches of
production they now hold in their hands<span class="corr" id=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Climate.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The average shade temperature of Manila all the year
round is 83&deg; Fahrenheit. The highest I have ever seen there was
96&deg;, at 2 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> in May, and the lowest
68&deg;, at 6 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> in December.</p>
<p>The temperature of the sea-water on the shore at Malate is usually
82&deg;, and that of well-water about the same. The water-pipes from
the reservoir at San Juan del Monte are not buried, but are carried on
an embankment. They are partly shaded from the sun by clumps of
bamboos, but on a hot afternoon the water sometimes attains a
temperature of 90&deg;.</p>
<p>Those figures are high, yet the heat is mitigated by the sea-breeze,
and the nights are usually cool enough to allow a refreshing sleep.</p>
<p>The climate of Manila is not harmful to the constitutions of healthy
Europeans or Americans between twenty and fifty years of age, provided
they at once adopt a mode of life suitable to the country, and in
clothing, diet, habits and recreations, adapt themselves to the new
conditions. On the other hand, I apprehend that, for persons of either
sex over fifty who have had no previous experience of life in the
tropics, there will be great difficulty in acclimatising <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>themselves, and the mortality amongst such will
be abnormal. Ladies&rsquo; complexions will not suffer more than if
they lived in a steam-heated house in Harlem, New York.</p>
<p>In all this part of the world the weather depends upon the monsoons.
These blow with great regularity over the ocean, six months from the
north-east and six months from the south-west. Their action on any
particular place is, however, modified by the situation of mountains
with regard to that place. The changes of the monsoon occur in
April&mdash;May and October&mdash;November. It is the south-west
monsoon that brings rain to Manila, and it has a fine stretch of the
China Sea to career over, all the way, in fact, from the shores of
Sumatra, till it drives the billows tumbling and foaming into the
bay.</p>
<p>The typhoons form far out in the Pacific near the region of the
Western Carolines, and, whirling round the opposite way to the hands of
a watch, they proceed on a curve that may strike Luzon, or, perhaps, go
on for a thousand miles or more, and carry death and destruction to the
fishermen of Fo Kien or Japan.</p>
<p>When a typhoon passes clear, the usual result is several days of
continuous heavy rain, but the air is cleared and purified. But should
the vortex of the cyclone pass over your residence, you will not be
likely to forget it for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>The year in Manila may be roughly divided into three
seasons:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Rainy Season&mdash;June, July, August, September. In these four
months about 100 inches of rain may fall, and 20 more in the rest of
the year.</li>
<li>Cool Season (so-called)&mdash;October, November, December,
January.</li>
<li>Hot Season&mdash;February, March, April, May.</li>
</ul>
<p>May is the terrible month of the year, the month of fevers and
funerals. Let all who can, leave Manila before this month arrives.</p>
<p>Hot, dry winds, dust-laden, pervade the houses, and have such an
effect even on well-seasoned hardwoods, that tables, wardrobes and
door-panels, split from end to end, or from top to bottom, with a noise
like a pistol-shot, leaving cracks a quarter of an inch wide that gape
till the rainy season restores the moisture. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span></p>
<p>At this time the heat is at its maximum, and all nature gasps or
fades. Not a drop of rain has fallen for months, the roads are inches
deep in dust, the rivers nearly stagnant, and covered with a green
scum, the whole country quite brown, the vegetation burnt up by the
sun. Only the cockroaches rejoice; at this season they fly at night,
and you may have a few fine specimens of the <i>Blatta Orientalis</i>
alight on your face, or on the back of your neck, should you doze a
moment on your long chair. Personally, I am proof against a good deal,
but must confess that the hairy feet of a cockroach on my face or neck
make me shudder.</p>
<p>As the month draws to a close, every afternoon the storm-clouds
gather over the Antipolo Hills. All Manila, lying in the glare and
dust, prays for rain. Overhead, a sky like burnished copper darts down
heat-rays that penetrate the roofs, and literally strike the heads of
the occupants. The dry air is surcharged with electricity to such an
extent that every living thing feels the powerful influence; the
sweetest natures become irritable, and quite ready to admit that
&ldquo;this is, indeed, a <i>beastly</i> world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nervous system suffers, the newspapers relate cases of stabbing,
or even running <i>amok</i> amongst the natives, and perhaps some
suicides occur. If, as not unfrequently happens, you should at this
time receive an invitation to the funeral of a friend or compatriot
just deceased from typhoid fever, and to be buried within twenty-four
hours, you will begin to wonder whether Manila is good enough for you.
Day after day the rain-clouds disperse amidst the rumbling of a distant
thunder-storm, and day after day do longing eyes watch for their
coming, and hope for the cloud-burst.</p>
<p>At last, when the limit of endurance seems reached, a cool breath of
air heralds the downpour. The leaves rustle, the feathery bamboos
incline before the blast, the sky darkens, the cataracts of heaven are
loosed, and the water tumbles down in torrents.</p>
<p>Now keep yourself in the house, and on the upper floor, and let the
water from your roofs run to waste. The natives, usually so careless of
a wetting, avoid bathing or wetting themselves with the first waters,
which they consider dangerous, and not without reason. The exhalations
from the newly-wetted earth are to be avoided; these earth-vapours are
called by the Tagals <i>Alim&oacute;om</i>. Now the dust is washed off
the roofs and leaves, and in three <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176"
href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>days the fallows are covered
with small shoots of grass or weeds, the maidenhair ferns and mosses
spring from every stone wall. The reign of dust is over; the reign of
mud begins. Now the frogs inaugurate their nightly concerts. After a
time you get used to the deafening noise; you do not even hear it. But
they suddenly stop, and you are astonished at the stillness.</p>
<p>As the rainy season proceeds, the air is almost entirely saturated
with moisture: the saturation in August sometimes exceeds 97 per
cent.</p>
<p>Now green mould will grow upon your boots and other leather
articles, if left a couple of days without cleaning. Everything feels
damp, and it is a good plan to air your wardrobe round a brazier of
red-hot charcoal.</p>
<p>You will have noticed that the natives universally build their
houses upon piles. So do the Malays all over the Far East. This is the
expression of the accumulated experience of centuries, and you will be
wise to conform to it by never sleeping on the ground floor. To a
dweller in the Philippines this tip is worth the price of the book.</p>

<h3 class="main">Dress.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The dress of both sexes should be as light as
possible; my advice is, wear as little as possible, and wear it thin
and loose. The access of air to the body is necessary to carry off the
perspiration, some of which is in the form of vapour.</p>
<p>Ladies will find the greatest comfort in the simple but elegant
dresses called <i>batas</i>, which are princess robes made of
embroidered cambric or lawn. The materials for these dresses can be
purchased in Manila, and excellent sempstresses and embroiderers can be
hired at moderate wages, and the dresses made in the house. For the
evenings, thin silk or muslin dresses, cut low, are most suitable.</p>

</div>
<p>Men who are young and robust should wear white duck jackets, and
trousers without waistcoats. Elderly men, or those subject to
rheumatism, will do well to wear thin flannel suits. The material for
these can be got in Hong Kong. For travelling and shooting, unbleached
linen, guingon, or rayadillo, is the best material, made into Norfolk
jackets and pantaloons. I always found white or brown leather shoes the
best wear, and canvas shooting-boots capped and strapped with leather.
A Panama hat, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>or a solar topee, is the best head-wear. If one
has to be much in the sun, a white umbrella, lined with green, should
be carried. Dress is not an expensive item in Manila. Up to 1892, the
washing for a whole family, with bed and table-linen, could be done for
$12 per month.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Houses.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most of the older houses in Manila are of ample size,
and well suited to the climate, but some of the newer ones, built to
the designs of a Spanish architect, and having glass windows, are very
hot and uncomfortable. It is essential to live in a good-sized house,
so as to escape the heat by moving to a different part as the sun goes
round. Thus you will have your early breakfast in one corner of the
balcony; your tiffin, perhaps, on the ground floor; your tea in the
open corridor looking on the garden, and your dinner, at 7.30
<span class="sc">P.M.</span>, in the dining-room under the punkah.</p>
<p>House-rent is paid monthly, and, up to 1892, a good detached house
of moderate size could be got in one of the best suburbs for $100 per
month, and for less in Santa Ana. Such a house would stand in its own
garden, and would have stables for several horses, and shelter for one
or two carriages.</p>
<p>I understand that house-rent is now nearly doubled in consequence of
the American competition. From their lavish expenditure, we must infer
that the new-comers possess large private means in addition to their
salaries.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Furniture.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The furnishing of a tropical house is much simplified,
because no carpets or curtains are needed. The floors are of polished
hardwood, and they take a good deal of work to keep them in good order.
A few rugs can be put down here and there, if a little colour is
required. Where the floor is bad, Chinese matting can be laid down at
small expense. Some of the Mestizos import costly furniture, but few of
the European residents attempted to follow their example. Vienna
bent-wood furniture, with cane seats, was commonly used, and was very
suitable, also bamboo or rattan furniture, brought from China or made
in the country. Such things as wardrobes or bookcases should have
ring-bolts on each side for lashing to the walls. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>A
child or grown person might be killed by a heavy piece of furniture
falling on it during an earthquake.</p>
<p>Furniture of all sorts is made in Manila of Red Narra, or other
wood, by Chinese cabinet-makers, who will work to purchasers&rsquo;
requirements. Very excellent teak-wood furniture is made in Hong Kong
and Shanghai.</p>
<p>The problem of furnishing a large house for a moderate sum, and
making it comfortable, and at the same time artistic and refined, is
not a difficult one, and has often been very satisfactorily solved in
Manila.</p>
<p>Large stoneware flower-pots and pedestals can be purchased in
Manila, and no more suitable ornament can be found than handsome palms,
ferns, or flowering plants, for halls, corridors, or reception
rooms.</p>
<p>The beds should be large, and have thin, hard mattresses and
horse-hair pillows stuffed rather hard. The coolest thing to lie upon
is a fine grass mat, or <i>petate</i>. Covering is seldom required. On
the bed will be seen a large bolster lying at right angles to the
pillows, so as to be parallel to the sleeper. The use of this is not
apparent to the newly-arrived Briton or American. This is the
<i>Abrazador</i>, used throughout the boundless East.</p>
<p>The candidate for repose, whether on the hard bed, or harder floor
or deck, lies on his side, and rests his upper arm and leg on the
<i>Abrazador</i>, thus relieving his hip and shoulder from much of his
weight. He takes care to keep it a little way off his body to allow the
air to circulate.</p>
<p>A mosquito-net must be fitted to every bed, but may not always be
required. In the sleeping-room there should be no curtains, and the
least possible amount of furniture, and, during the hot season, the bed
should stand in the middle of the room. It is advisable to have no
light in the bedroom, but good lights are a necessity in the
dressing-rooms.</p>
<p>By being careful about this you will keep your bedroom free from
mosquitoes. Petroleum is commonly used in the Philippines for lighting,
and unless the lamps are of the best quality, and carefully trimmed,
there is considerable danger of accident. I used to keep some plants in
pots in each room so as to throw the earth over any oil that might get
alight. Whenever there was a shock of earthquake, I extinguished the
petroleum lamps, and lighted candles instead. And whenever we went out
to a dinner or dance, every petroleum lamp was extinguished, and
cocoanut-oil <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>lights or candles substituted in case of an
earthquake whilst we were out.</p>
<p>Frequent baths are indispensable to good health in Manila. Enormous
earthenware tubs, made in China, can be procured. These are placed in
the bath-room, and filled in the evening, so that the water gets
refreshingly cool during the night. It is not at all advisable to get
into the water, as the effect is not so good as dashing the water over
the head with a small bucket called a <i>tabo</i>. By using the water
thus, and rubbing the skin briskly with a towel, a reaction soon sets
in, and the bather feels quite invigorated.</p>
<p>A bath of this kind when rising, and another before dressing for
dinner, will do much to mitigate the rigour of the climate.</p>
<p>From several stories told me by friends recently returned from
Manila, it would seem that the Americans there, or some of them, at
least, are not sufficiently alive to the necessity of daily baths, but
I refrain from giving particulars.</p>
<p>This seems strange when one remembers the profusion with which baths
are provided in all the modern hotels in the great cities of
America.</p>
<p>Now I must tell you about gogo. This is the dried bark of a creeper
that grows wild in the woods, and it is the finest thing possible to
keep your hair in order.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of this plant, the three most commonly used
are gogo bayugo (<i lang="la-x-bio">Entada scandens</i> Benth.); gogong
casay (<i lang="la-x-bio">Peltophorum ferrugineum</i> Benth.); gogong
paltaning (<i lang="la-x-bio">Albizzia saponaria</i> Blum.).</p>
<p>As washing the hair with gogo is one of the luxuries of the
Philippines, I shall describe how it is done.</p>
<p>A servant pounds a piece of the stem and bark, and steeps it in a
basin, twisting and wringing it occasionally until the soluble part has
been extracted. He then adds to the liquor two or three limes,
squeezing the juice out, and soaking the peel. He also throws in a
handful of crushed citron-leaves, and strains the liquor through
muslin.</p>
<p>The servant then ladles this over your head with a calabash, or
cocoa-nut shell, whilst you rub your hair with your hands.</p>
<p>As the liquor is strongly alkaline, you must be careful to keep your
eyes closed until the head has been rinsed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>with
water. Your hair-wash is made fresh whenever you want it, and may cost
from two to three pence.</p>
<p>The fragrance of the citron-leaves is delicious, and when you have
rinsed and dried your hair, you will find it as soft, as bright, and as
sweet-smelling as the costliest perfumes of Bond Street could make
it.</p>

<h3 class="main">Servants.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the good old times we were well off for servants in
Manila. They flocked up from the provinces seeking places, and those
employers who took pains to enquire closely into the antecedents of
applicants, could almost ensure being well served.</p>
<p>Englishmen paid good wages, and paid punctually, hence they could
command the best servants.</p>
<p>Personally, I may say that I kept my servants for years&mdash;some
nearly the whole time I was in the islands. I had very little trouble
with any of them. There are people who say that they have no feeling,
but I remember that when I embarked with my family on leaving Manila,
my servants, on taking leave at the wharf, were convulsed with tears at
our departure.</p>

</div>
<p>American competition for servants has more than doubled these rates
of pay. Cooks get $50 now.</p>
<p>The house-boys and maid live in the house, and sleep on the floor,
with a grass mat and pillows. The mayordomo sometimes lives quite near,
being, perhaps, a married <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href=
"#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>man. The coachman has his room by
the stables, and the gardener lives in the lodge, or in a small hut in
the garden.</p>
<p>The <i>maestro-cook</i> does not usually sleep on the premises. He
arrives about 11 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, bearing two baskets
depending from a <i>pinga</i>, or palma-brava staff, resting on his
shoulder. These baskets will contain the day&rsquo;s
marketing&mdash;eggs, fish, meat, chicken, salad, tomatoes, bananas,
firewood, and many other things.</p>
<p>He promptly sets to work, and by twelve, or half-past, presents a
tiffin of three or four courses.</p>
<p>His afternoon is devoted to preparing the more elaborate dinner due
at 7.30 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, when he will be ready to serve
soup, fish, entr&eacute;es, a roast, a curry, and sweets, all
conscientiously prepared, and sent in hot. Most excellent curries are
made in Manila, both by Chinamen and natives. To my mind, the best are
made from prawns, from crab, or from frogs&rsquo; legs. If you cannot
eat anything else at dinner, you can always make out with the
curry.</p>
<p>The dinner over, the cook asks for orders, and takes his departure,
to return with perfect punctuality the following day.</p>
<p>The Chinese cooks all belong to a guild, which is a trades&rsquo;
union and a co-operative society, and are bound to follow the
rules.</p>
<p>They would never dream of going into a market and bidding one
against the other.</p>
<p>Their system is to assemble early every morning at the guild house,
and for each man to state his requirements. A scribe then tabulates the
orders&mdash;so many turkeys, so many chickens, etc., and two
experienced cooks are commissioned as buyers to go into the market and
purchase the whole lot, the provisions being afterwards fairly divided
amongst the members, each having his turn to get the choice pieces,
such as saddle of mutton, kidneys, etc. But if a dinner-party is
contemplated, the cook who has to prepare it gets the preference.</p>
<p>They thus obtain everything much cheaper than the native cooks, even
after taking a good squeeze for themselves. I believe that they have a
fixed percentage which they charge, and would consider it dishonest to
take any more, whilst the guild would not approve of their taking any
less.</p>
<p>If you send away your cook, the guild will settle for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>you
who is to replace him. All your culinary fancies will be well known to
the council of the guild, and they will pick out a man up to your
standard.</p>
<p>It was customary to give the cook a fixed sum per day to provide
tiffin and dinner, and this was paid once a week.</p>
<p>I found that two dollars a day was sufficient to amply provide for
my family, and I could have one guest to tiffin or dinner without
notice, and be confident that the meal would be sufficient. In fact,
this was part of my agreement with the cook. By giving short notice,
the dinner could be extended for two or three people at an additional
charge.</p>
<p>The cook rendered no account of the money he received; but, if I was
not satisfied with the meals he provided, I admonished him, and if he
did not do better I discharged him. I may say, however, that there was
very seldom cause for complaint, for the Chinese are thorough business
men.</p>
<p>When a dinner-party was given, the cook provided according to order,
and sent in his bill for the extras. There was no housekeeping, and no
need to order anything, and you knew exactly how much you were spending
weekly, and how much a dinner-party cost.</p>
<p>The cleaning and polishing your plate and glass, the laying the
table, the tasteful adorning of it with variegated leaves, with ferns
or flowers, and the artistic folding of the serviettes, may with
confidence be left to the mayordomo&rsquo;s care; every detail will be
attended to down to the ylang-ylang flowers in the finger-bowls.</p>
<p>With such servants as these, the mistress of the house, free from
domestic cares, may take her shower-bath, and, clad in Kabaya and
Sarong, await the moment when she must resume the garments of
civilisation, and receive her guests looking as fresh, in spite of the
thermometer, as if she had stepped out of a <i>coup&eacute;</i> in
Piccadilly or Fifth Avenue. Ladies used to the ministry of Irish Biddy
or Aunt Chloe ought to fancy themselves transported to heaven when they
find themselves at the head of a household in Manila.</p>
<p>I append a note of household expenses for a family living moderately
in Manila in 1892. I suppose the cost has been doubled under American
rule. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=

<h3 class="main">Diet.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For the benefit of Boston readers (if I should be
lucky enough to have any in that learned city), I may say that pork and
beans is not a suitable diet for a tropical country. I should also
forbid the &ldquo;New England dinner,&rdquo; and roast goose, or
sucking pig, stewed terrapin, and pumpkin pie. A light diet of eggs or
the excellent fish to be had in Manila, chickens fattened on maize,
beef or mutton, once a day, and rice, vegetables and salad, with plenty
of ripe fruit, according to the season, is desirable. The fare can be
diversified by oysters, prawns, crabs, wild duck, snipe, and quail, all
of which are cheap and very good in the season. There are no pheasants
in Luzon, but the jungle cock (labuyao) is as good or better.</p>
<p>In the tropics a good table is a necessity, for the appetite needs
tempting. Such a diet as I have mentioned will keep you in health,
especially if you are careful not to eat too much, but to eat of the
best. If you economise on your table you will have to spend the money
at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>drug-store. Taboo pork, because&mdash;well, when
you have been a week or two in the country you will not need to ask
why&mdash;Moses and Mahomet knew what they were about.</p>
<p>My remarks about drinks are intended for the men, as ladies do not
need any advice on this subject. In a tropical climate it is necessary
to be very careful in the use of spirits.</p>
<p>Having lived for more than twenty-five years in the tropics, and
having kept my health remarkably well, I feel warranted in giving my
experience. I have made surveys, or directed works, in many climates,
exposed to all weathers, and I know that the very worst thing a man can
take, if he has to work or march in the sun, is spirits. There is
nothing that will predispose him to sunstroke as much as spirits. For
marching, walking, or shooting, in the sun, I know nothing like cold
tea without milk or sugar. It should be poured off the leaves after
infusing for two minutes.</p>
<p>When you reach shelter you can take a lemon squash or a
<i>cagelada</i>&mdash;this is the juice of cageles (a kind of orange)
with sugar and water&mdash;which is a most cooling drink. Never take
spirits to buck you up to your work. Whatever spirits you drink, let it
be after sunset. I am a believer in drinking wine at meals; it makes me
shudder to see people drinking tea, lemonade, or milk, with their
dinners, and laying up for themselves torments from dyspepsia, for
which they have to swallow pills by the boxful.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ponies.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a race of ponies in the islands that is
descended from Spanish and Arab horses, and owing to an absolutely
haphazard breeding, the size has diminished, although the symmetry has
been preserved. Those from Ilocos are the smallest, but they are the
hardiest and most spirited.</p>
<p>A pair of ponies and a Victoria is an absolute necessity for a lady
in Manila, and I have little doubt that an American judge would declare
the &ldquo;failure to provide&rdquo; to be cruelty and grant a divorce
if applied for.</p>
<p>Both harness and carriages are made in the city, but imported
harness can be had, better finished, at double the price.</p>

<p>In my time a fine pair of ponies could be bought for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>$200
to $300; a new Victoria for $500, and harness for $60. The cost of
keeping a pair of ponies was $16 per month, and a coachman $12 per
month, food, and livery. What the cost is now I have no
information.</p>
<p>The public carriages were not fit for a lady to use, though
sometimes a suitable one could be hired by the week or month from a
livery stable.</p>
<p>The ponies are wonderfully strong and sure-footed. I weigh over 200
lbs., yet some of these ponies have carried me about all day over rough
ground without stumbling. They carry a lady beautifully, and riding is
the best form of exercise a lady can take.</p>

<p class="first">The garden will be a great source of occupation to the
mistress of the house. If it is sheltered from the wind and supplied
with water, she can grow almost anything. And plants will come up
quickly, too, under the influence of the heat and moisture.</p>
<p>There are nursery gardens at Pasay, where all sorts of plants and
seedlings can be obtained; in fact, these are hawked about morning and
evening.</p>
<p>The so-called gardener rarely has much skill, but he will clean up
the garden and water it, and do what he is told.</p>
<p>The most beautiful and delicate ferns can be grown, and magnificent
orchids got to flower, if they are well sheltered in a mat-shed.
Bananas and pines grow without trouble, and radishes, salads, tomatoes,
cucumbers, and melons, can be raised.</p>

drug-stores are mostly in German hands, but there is one English one
where the usual English articles can be got.</p>
<p>There is an ample supply of wines, spirits, and preserved provisions
at the grocers, and the drapers keep on hand any quantity of silks,
muslins, and piece-goods, with all the necessary fixings. French and
German shoes are in plenty.</p>
<p>The goods in the jewellers&rsquo; shops and in the fancy bazaars are
all of a very florid style, to suit the gaudy taste of the wealthy
Filipinos. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=

<p>Such piece-goods and haberdashery as are in common use are brought
round to the ladies at their own houses by Chinese hawkers, who, having
small expenses, sell remarkably cheap.</p>
<p>They are always very civil and attentive, and will gladly get you
any article that they have not in stock at the moment.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The amusements for ladies were limited to riding,
lawn-tennis, boating, picnics, and frequent dances. I remember many
delightful dances in Manila. One was given to the officers of the
U.S.S. <i>Brooklyn</i>, and another to the U.S.S. <i>Richmond</i>. At
the latter, the ladies were in <i>traje del pais</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
dressed as natives and mestizas. And very handsome some of them looked.
Now and again some theatrical company would come over, mostly from
Saigon. There were a good many dinner parties given amongst the British
community, and weekly receptions at most of the principal houses,
during the time I lived in Manila, where you could get a little game of
cards, dance, flirt, or take it easy, just as you liked.</p>
<p>The ladies very wisely took a rest from two to four, to be fresh for
the evening. The proper hour for calling was at 9 P.M. or 10 A.M. on
Sundays after High Mass.</p>
<p>I knew several ladies, English and American, who look back upon a
term of years spent in Manila as the happiest in their lives.</p>
<p>Children born in Manila can remain there without damage to their
health till ten or twelve years old, and after having spent a few years
at home are indistinguishable from children born and brought up in
England.</p>
<p>The principal thing lacking in Manila is means of access to the
hills where people could go occasionally for a change and during the
hot season. I have little doubt that the Americans will provide this
before long.</p>
<p>Manila was not without its frivolous element; but there was one
period of the year when all frivolities were suspended, and religious
observances monopolised the people&rsquo;s time. That was in Lent, and
the ceremonies culminated on Good Friday. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Very Noble and always Loyal City of Manila celebrates the
greatest day of the Christian year very devoutly. On foot, and robed in
black, its inhabitants high and low throng the churches and attend the
procession.</p>
<p>All shops are closed, vehicular traffic is suspended, the ensigns
hang at half-mast, the yards of ships are crossed in saltire; not a
sound is heard.</p>
<p>The capital and the whole of the civilised Philippines mark the
crucifixion of our Saviour by two days of devotion, of solemn calm.
Under Spanish rule a stately procession, attended by the highest and
the humblest, filed slowly through the silent streets, the Civil
Government, the Law, the Army, the Navy, the Municipality and the
Religious Orders, being represented by deputations in full dress, who
followed bare-headed the emblems of the faith in the presence of an
immense crowd of natives, who bent the knee and bowed the head in
homage to the crucified Saviour.</p>
<p>I never failed to witness this imposing spectacle when in Manila,
and it was mortifying to me to remember that Good Friday in London is
nothing but a vulgar holiday, and that probably not one person out of a
hundred in its vast population realises in the least degree the event
that solemn fast is intended to commemorate.</p>
<p>The death-like stillness of Good Friday remained unbroken till High
Mass was over on Saturday morning, when the cathedral bells rang out a
joyous peal, soon taken up by the bells of the numerous churches in the
city and all over the provinces.</p>
<p>The ensigns were run up to the staff or peak, the yards were
squared, and royal salutes thundered out over land and sea, whilst
clouds of white smoke enveloped the moss-grown ramparts of the saluting
battery, and the useless, lumbering masts and spars of the flagship.
Then steam-whistles and sirens commenced their hideous din, the great
doors of the houses were thrown open, and hundreds of bare-backed
ponies, with half-naked grooms, issued at full gallop to the sea or
river.</p>
<p>Then Manila resumed its every-day life till the next Holy Thursday
came round. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Manila was not so badly off for sport as might be
thought. The pony-races, conducted under the auspices of the Jockey
Club, excited the greatest interest amongst all classes.</p>
<p>The ponies underwent their training at the race-course in Santa
Mesa, and their owners and other members of the club were provided with
early breakfast there. The native grooms took as much interest in the
success of the pony they attended as the owner, and they backed their
favourite for all they were worth.</p>
<p>Only members were allowed to ride, and the weights were remarkably
heavy for such small ponies. When the races came off, business was
almost suspended for three days, and all Manila appeared at the
race-course. There were sometimes two thousand vehicles and immense
crowds on foot.</p>
<p>The ladies in their most resplendent toilettes were received by the
stewards, presented with elegantly-bound programmes, and conducted to
their places on the grand stand.</p>
<p>Presently a military band would strike up the &ldquo;Marcha
R&eacute;al,&rdquo; as the Governor-General&rsquo;s equipage entered
the enclosure, and that exalted personage, dressed in black frock coat
and silk hat, white trousers and waistcoat, with the crimson silk sash
of a general, just peeping from under his waistcoat, was conducted to
his box, followed by his suite and the favoured persons invited to join
his party. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>The highest authority in the country presided and handed the prizes
to the winning jockeys, who were brought up to him by the
vice-president of the club. But on an occasion when the
Governor-General and Segundo Cabo were absent, I witnessed the races
which were presided over by no less a personage than His Grace the
Archbishop of Manila, Fray Pedro Payo, in his archiepiscopal garments,
and smoking a big Havana cigar. The old gentleman enjoyed the sport and
most graciously presented the handsome prizes to the winners.</p>
<p>Betting was conducted by the totalisator, or pari-mutuel, the bet
being five dollars, repeated as often as you liked. As I presume my
readers understand this system, I shall not describe it. The natives
bet amongst themselves to a considerable amount.</p>
<p>Pavilions were erected by different clubs or bodies, and a profuse
hospitality characterised each day. Winners of large silver cups
usually filled them with champagne and passed them round. Bets were
made with the ladies as an excuse for giving them presents.
Dinner-parties were given in the evenings at private houses, and there
were dinners at the clubs. There were two race-meetings in the year. No
doubt this sport, temporarily interrupted by insurrection and war, will
again flourish when tranquillity prevails.</p>
<p>There was a boating-club in connection with the British Club at
Nagtajan, now removed to Ermita, and some very good skiffs and boats
were available. There was a regatta and illuminated procession of boats
each year.</p>
<p>Polo clubs and rifle clubs had a rather precarious existence, except
that the Swiss Rifle Club was well kept up, and there were some
excellent shots in it. There was a lawn tennis club, which had ladies
and gentlemen as members, and some very good games were played there
and valuable prizes given.</p>
<p>Shooting was a favourite sport with many Englishmen and a few
mestizos.</p>
<p>Excellent snipe-shooting is to be had in all the paddy-fields around
Manila and the lake. But at San Pedro on the Pasig, there is a wide
expanse of rough ground with clumps of bushes, and it was here that the
most exciting sport was to be had, and it took some shooting to get the
birds as they flew across the openings between the bushes.
Snipe-shooting began in September, when the paddy was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>high
enough to give cover, and lasted to the end of November. The birds,
when they first arrived, were thin, but they soon put on flesh, and by
November were fat and in splendid condition for the table. There is no
better bird to be eaten anywhere than a Manila snipe. Bags of eighty
were sometimes made in a morning by two guns.</p>
<p>Excellent wild-duck and teal-shooting was to be got on and around
the lake and on the Pinag de Candaba, and wherever there was a sheet of
water. When crossing the lake I have seen wild fowl resting on the
surface in such enormous numbers that they looked like sandbanks. They
are not easy to approach, but I have killed some by firing a rifle into
the flock. The crested-lapwing and the golden-plover are in plenty, and
on the seashores widgeon and curlew abound. Inland, on the stubbles,
there are plenty of quail. Pigeons of all sorts, sizes, and colours,
abound at all times, especially when the dap-dap tree opens its large
crimson blossoms. Some kinds of brush-turkeys, such as the tabon, a
bird (<i>Megapodius cuningi</i>) the size of a partridge, that lays an
egg as large as a goose egg and buries it in a mound of gravel by the
shore, are found.</p>
<p>The labuyao, or jungle cock, is rare and not easy to shoot in a
sportsmanlike way, although a poacher could easily shoot them on a
moonlight night.</p>
<p>In the Southern Islands some remarkable pheasants of most brilliant
plumage are to be found, and whilst in Palawan I obtained two good
specimens of the pavito real (<i>Polyplectron Napoleonis</i>), a very
handsome game bird with two sharp spurs on each leg. They are rather
larger than a partridge, but their fan-shaped tails have two rows of
eyes like a peacock&rsquo;s tail, there being four eyes in each
feather.</p>
<p>Deer and wild-pig abound, and can be shot within four hours&rsquo;
journey of Manila by road. Round about Montalban is a good place for
them. They are plentiful at Jala-jala, on the lake at Porac in
Pampanga, and round about the Puerto Jamelo and Pico de Loro, at the
mouth of Manila Bay. In fact, they are found wherever there is cover
and pasture for them. The season is from December to April.</p>
<p>The usual way is to go with a party of five or six guns and employ
some thirty native beaters, each bringing one or two dogs.</p>
<p>The guns are stationed in suitable spots and the beaters and their
dogs, fetching a compass, extend their line and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>drive the game up to the guns. This is rather an
expensive amusement, as you have to pay and feed the beaters and their
dogs; but it is very good sport, and in proceeding and returning to
camp from two beats in the morning and two in the afternoon, you got
quite as much exercise as you want or as is good for you. The venison
and wild-pig is very good eating, but it is difficult to get it to
Manila fresh, whatever precautions you take.</p>
<p>Taken all round, Luzon is well supplied with game, and may be
considered satisfactory from a sportsman&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p>There is no sport to be had in fishing; in Luzon, so far as I know,
there are no game fish. When living on the banks of the Rio Grande,
near Macab&eacute;be, I noticed some natives taking fish at night by
placing a torch on the bow of a canoe, which was paddled by one man
slowly along near the bank, another man standing in the bow with a
fish-spear of three prongs, similar to the &ldquo;grains&rdquo; used in
England. As the fish came up to the light he struck at them with his
spear and managed to pick up a good many.</p>
<p>This appeared good sport, and I arranged for a native to come for me
in a canoe with torch, and I borrowed a spear. We started off, but
there was some difficulty in standing up in a small, narrow canoe, and
darting the spear. My first stroke was a miss, the fish escaped; my
second, however, was all right, and I shook my catch off the spear into
the canoe, but the native shouted out, &ldquo;M&aacute;samang
&aacute;has p&oacute;!&rdquo; (a poisonous snake, sir) not forgetting
to be polite even in that somewhat urgent situation. The snake was
wriggling towards me, but I promptly picked him up again on the spear
and threw him overboard, much to my own relief and that of the
Pampanga.</p>
<p>It was one of those black and yellow water-snakes, reputed as
poisonous. That was enough fishing for me, and I remembered that I had
a particular appointment at home, and left fishing to
professionals.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, fish cannot be taken by the trawl, for a mestizo
got out a trawling steamer with gear, and men to handle it, and after
repeated trials in different places, had to give it up as a bad job.

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The island of Luzon is of so irregular a shape that it
cannot be intelligibly described without the aid of a map.</p>
<p>That part of it to the north and west of the isthmus of Tayabas lies
with its longitudinal axis due north and south, and has a fairly even
coast line, there being only two great indentations, the Bays of
Lingayen and Manila, both on the west coast. There are also on that
side and to the south the smaller bays of Subic, Balayan, Batangas, and
Tayabas.</p>
<p>On the east coast of this northern part are the unimportant bays of
Palanan, Dilasac, Casiguran and Baler, besides the great bay of Lamon,
sheltered by the islands Calbalete and Alabat.</p>
<p>But in the remainder of Luzon, from the isthmus of Tayabas eastward
and southward, the coast line is most irregular, and the width much
reduced. A chain of mountains commencing at and forming the two
above-mentioned islands and running in a south-easterly direction forms
the peninsula of Tayabas.</p>
<p>Another range, starting near the Bay of Sogod, runs a little south
of east as far as Mount Labo (1552 metres), turns south-east, and runs
along the southern shore of the fertile valley of the River Vicol, and
with many a break <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193"
name="pb193">193</a>]</span>and twist and turn reaches Mount Bulusan,
whose slopes run down to the waters of the Strait of San Bernardino.
The convolutions of this range form on the south the secure harbour of
Sorsogon, and on the north the bays of Albay, Tabaco, Lagonoy and
Sogod, besides a multitude of smaller ports and bays, for the coast
line is wonderfully broken up by spurs of the main ranges running out
into the sea. Luzon generally is very mountainous, and more especially
so that part lying to the north of 16&deg; 5&prime;, where the great
ranges of mountains run in crooked lines but with general north and
south direction. The range running parallel to the Pacific coast is
called, in its most southern part, the Caraballos de Baler, and the
rest of it, up to Punta Escarpada, is known as the Cordillera del Este,
or the Sierra Madre. The central range, starting from Mount Caraballo
in the latitude before mentioned, is called the Cordillera Central for
about a degree of latitude, and from there is known as the Cordillera
del Norte, terminating at Punta Lacatacay, in longitude 121&deg; east
of Greenwich.</p>
<p>The mountains on the western coast are not so lofty, nor do they
form a connected range. They are known as the Sierras de Ilocos. Some
of these ranges are thirty or forty miles long. There are cuts in
places where rivers find an outlet to the sea, such as the Rio Grande
de Laoag, the Rio Abra, and some lesser streams. All these ranges have
spurs or buttresses. Those of the Central Cordillera extend as far, and
join with, the coast range on the west, covering the whole country and
leaving no large plain anywhere, for the valley of the Abra though long
is very narrow. There is a little flat land about Vigan.</p>
<p>But the eastern spurs of the central range, in the part of Luzon
under consideration, do not interlace with the spurs of Sierra Madre,
but leave a magnificent valley more than two degrees of latitude in
length and varying breadth. This is the only great valley of northern
Luzon, and through it runs the Rio Grande de Cagayan and its
tributaries, the Magat and the Rio Chico, with numerous minor
streams.</p>
<p>Coasting steamers with about twelve feet draught cross the bar of
the Rio Grande and lie at Aparri. The river is navigable in the dry
season as far as Alcal&aacute; for light draught steamers. Alligators
abound in these rivers. In this valley, which extends through the
provinces of Cagayan and Isabela up into Nueva Vizcaya, there is to be
found a great extension of rich alluvial soil on which can be raised,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>besides other tropical crops, most excellent
tobacco, the cultivation of which was for many years obligatory upon
the inhabitants, who were forbidden to grow rice.</p>
<p>Little has been done in the way of making a trigonometrical survey
of the Highlands of Luzon, but some military reconnaissance sketches
have been made from time to time by staff or engineer officers employed
in building forts, and from these several maps have been compiled. One
of the most complete of these is by that intrepid explorer and
painstaking geographer, D&rsquo;Almonte. Another map has been published
by Colonel Olleros. It must be admitted that these maps do not agree
with each other, but that is not unusual in maps of the Philippines,
and results from a custom of the Spanish engineers of doing too much in
the office and not enough in the field. Colonel Olleros has, however,
on his map shown the lesser known mountain ranges very vaguely, and has
left more than a thousand square miles of territory quite blank. This
tract lies between the central range and the Cagayan River, and is
inhabited by the Apayaos, Calingas, Aripas, and Nabayuganes. Olleros
also leaves some large blanks on the east coast, and he is quite right
to do so, for this coast has hardly been visited since Salcedo sailed
past it at the time of the Conquest, and nothing is known about that
part of the island which remains to this day in possession of the
savage Dumagas, a Negrito tribe. That coast is almost entirely
destitute of shelter, and is exposed to the full force of the Pacific
surf. It is made more dangerous by tidal waves which are formed either
by distant cyclones or by submarine upheavals and occur without
warning.</p>
<p>The largest and richest valley in Luzon is that which extends
without a break from the shores of the Bay of Lingayen to the Bay of
Manila, having an area of some 3000 square miles, and comprising the
best part of the Provinces of Pangasinan, Tarlac, Nueva &Eacute;cija,
Pampanga, Bulacan and Manila.</p>
<p>The town of Tarlac is situated about half-way between the two bays,
and approximately marks the watershed. About half-way between Tarlac
and the northern shores of Manila Bay there rises from the plain an
isolated mountain of volcanic origin, Mount Arayat. The crater has been
split through and the mountain thus shows two peaks. It is covered with
forest to the very summit. Arayat was thrown up within historic times,
and the Indians have a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=
"#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>tradition that it was completed in
one night, which is a most unlikely story.</p>
<p>Mount Arayat is 2880 feet in height, and in fine weather is plainly
visible from Manila and Cavite, and even from the mouth of the bay.</p>
<p>The principal rivers of this valley are the Agno, the Dagupan, the
Rio Grande and the Rio Chico of Pampanga.</p>
<p>The Agno rises in the mountains of Lepanto, runs south through the
province of Benguet, and S.W., W. and N.W. in Pangasinan into a
labyrinth of creeks communicating by many mouths with the Bay of
Lingayen. The river between Dagupan and San Isidro is navigable for
vessels drawing seven or eight feet, and such craft could reach Salasa.
From there to Rosales only lighters of very small draught could pass,
and after a long spell of dry weather rice-boats drawing only one foot
sometimes run aground. Its principal tributaries are the Tarlac and the
Camiling, with dozens of smaller streams bringing the whole drainage of
the eastern slopes of the Zambales mountains from Mount Iba to San
Isidro.</p>
<p>The Dagupan river rises in the mountains about the limits of Union
and Benguet and runs parallel to the Agno to 16&deg; N. lat., and
between it and the sea. Then it turns to the westward, and runs past
the towns of Urdaneta, Sta, Barbara, and Calasiao, entering the Bay of
Lingayen at Dagupan. It has a multitude of small tributaries which are
very differently shown on D&rsquo;Almonte&rsquo;s and Olleros&rsquo;
maps, and undoubtedly this part has never been surveyed.</p>
<p>The Pampanga river has its source on the southern slopes of the
Caraballo, in about 16&deg; 10&prime; N. lat. It runs south in two
branches, the Rio Grande and the Rio Chico; the first, being the
easternmost, receives the drainage from the western slopes of the
Cordillera del Este, whilst the Chico receives tributaries from both
sides in the flat country and also the overflow from the Lake of
Canarem.</p>
<p>These two branches unite just north of Mount Arayat, and continue in
a southerly direction. The river is navigable for small craft drawing
three feet as far as Candaba in the dry season, and in the rainy season
as far as San Isidro in Nueva &Eacute;cija. When in flood during the
rainy season, this river brings down a large body of water and annually
overflows its banks in certain places, where gaps occur. The escaping
water spreads itself over a low plain forming an inundation some
sixteen miles long and several miles wide, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>called the Pinag de Candaba. This remains during
the rainy season, and when the level of the Rio Grande has fallen
sufficiently, the water of the Pinag commences to fall also, and during
the middle and latter part of the dry season, and the beginning of the
rainy season, only patches of water remain here and there, which are
utilized for breeding fish, and a crop is raised on the land left dry.
A project for draining the Pinag and reclaiming the land was many years
ago got up by a Spanish colonel of engineers, and, at the request of an
English company, I went up to investigate and report on it. I found
that, irrespective of the difficulties and expense of the proposed
works, the vested rights of the natives of the many towns and villages
in and around the Pinag rendered it impossible to carry out the
scheme.</p>
<p>Vast flocks of wild duck and other water-fowl frequent the Pinag,
and good sport is to be had there. Below the Pinag the river spreads
itself over the low country, forming a labyrinths of creeks mostly
navigable for craft drawing three to four feet, but the mouths are all
very shallow and the bars can only be crossed about high tide. The
water is brackish or salt. An immense extent of country is intersected
by these creeks, certainly 200 square miles, and there are said to be
120 mouths connecting with the bay. With the exception of two or three
of the principal channels, this swamp has never been surveyed, and what
is shown on the map is merely guessed at. The muddy soil is covered
with mangrove in the low parts submerged at each tide, and with the
Nipa palm where the banks rise above high water. Under the heading
Pampangos will be found particulars of the manufacture of nipa-thatch
carried on here, and of collecting and distilling the juice. With the
exception of a few half-savage natives the only living things are
wildfowl, fish in abundance, alligators, snakes, and blue crabs. This
is indeed a great dismal swamp, more especially at low tide.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find one&rsquo;s way in these creeks, and
although I frequently traversed them, I found it necessary to take a
swamp Indian as a guide.</p>
<p>The city of Manila is situated astride the River Pasig on a strip of
land between the Bay of Manila and a great sheet of freshwater called
the Lake of Bay. In consequence of this situation, Manila can
communicate by the bay, the lake, the creeks and rivers with the
provinces of Bataan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197"
name="pb197">197</a>]</span>Pampanga, Nueva &Eacute;cija, Bulacan,
Morong, Laguna, and Cavite. Until the opening of the Manila-Dagupan
railroad the whole transport of the Archipelago was by water, and the
possession of navigable rivers meant progress and wealth, whilst the
absence of rivers meant stagnation and poverty. Around the city the
land is quite flat, but at about four miles distance there is a sharp
rise to a plateau of volcanic tuff, the surface of which is from sixty
to eighty feet above sea level, of which more anon. The River Pasig is
the overflow from the lake and the outlet for the River San Mateo,
which runs into it at right angles. The lake serves as a receiver for
the great floods that come down the San Mateo valley; for the level of
that river at Santolan, the intake of the waterworks, sometimes rises
more than twenty feet. When this occurs, the flood on reaching the
Pasig is divided; part runs into the lake, and part into the bay. The
current of the Pasig in that part between the junction of the San Mateo
and the outlet from the lake is reversed. Then when the flood subsides,
the water which has entered the lake runs out very slowly into the bay,
for the head produced by the greatest flood becomes insignificant from
being spread over the vast extent of the lake.</p>
<p>Rice, sugar, cocoa-nuts, bamboos, timber, and fruits are the
principal products of the province of La Laguna. The inhabitants supply
the Manila markets with poultry. The Pasig and the lake are navigated
by light draught steamers which ply daily to Bi&ntilde;an, Calamba, and
Santa Cruz. There are also numerous native small craft, which bring
down the produce. To the south of Manila the province of Cavite slopes
gently up from the shores of the bay and from the lake to the high
cliffs at the northern end of the volcanic lake of Taal. The valley is
intersected by numerous streams all of which run into the bay. Part of
this province, near Manila, is a stony and sandy desert, but other
parts of it are extremely fertile, and large crops of rice, with some
coffee, and cacao, and fruits, are raised. The Augustinians and
Dominicans have large estates here, and have expended considerable sums
on dams to retain water for irrigation.</p>
<p>The Lake of Bombon, or Taal, has in its centre an island containing
the remains of the volcano. From the nature of the surrounding country
it is conjectured that on the spot now occupied by the lake a volcanic
mountain, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>some 8000 feet high, formerly stood. The great
bed of volcanic tuff already mentioned, extending from thence up to
Meycauayan more than sixty miles distant, is thought to have been
ejected from that lofty volcano, leaving a vast hollow cone, which
ultimately collapsed, causing a convulsion in the surrounding country
that must have rivalled the famous cataclysm of Krakatoa. This is the
opinion of D. Jos&eacute; Centeno, a mining engineer employed by the
Spanish Government, and was fully confirmed by my learned friend, the
late Rev. J. E. Tenison-Wood, who carefully examined the locality, and
studied all the records.</p>
<p>The province of Batangas is very rich and fertile; it has some
mountains, but also a considerable extension of sloping or flat land.
In beauty it will compare with the best parts of Surrey, such as the
view from Leith Hill, looking south. Sugar and coffee are the principal
products, and the towns of Taal, Ba&uacute;ang, Batangas, and Lipa are
amongst the wealthiest of Luzon. The fields are well cultivated, and
oxen are much used, both for ploughing and for drawing carts. The beef
in this province is excellent.</p>
<p>Opposite to this beautiful and wealthy province lies the huge island
of Mindoro. Ever black and gloomy does it look, its lofty mountains
almost perpetually shrouded in rain-clouds. When I lived in Balayan I
had a good view of this island from my windows, and can scarcely
remember its looking otherwise than dark and forbidding. Nothing comes
from it but timber and jungle produce. There are known to be some beds
of lignite. Only the coast is known, and the jungle fever prevents
exploration. The island of Marinduque is healthier and more advanced.
It produces hemp of fine quality.</p>
<p>The province of Tayabas is very mountainous, and is still mostly
covered with forest; there are no wide valleys of alluvial soil. Some
rice is grown, also large quantities of cocoa-nuts, and some coffee and
cacao. Timber and jungle produce form the principal exports. I have
seen many specimens of minerals from this province and think it would
be well worth prospecting. But the climate is unhealthy, and dangerous
fevers prevail. This circumstance has been useful to the Spanish
Government, for when a governor or official had made himself disliked
he could be appointed to Tayabas with a fair prospect of getting rid of
him either by death or by invaliding in two or three years at most.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p>Camarines Norte is also mountainous, and there is not much
cultivation, only a little rice and hemp. The population is very
sparse, and the inhabitants are mostly employed (when they do anything)
in washing for gold at Mambulao, Paracale, and other places on the
Pacific coast. If they strike a pocket, or get a nugget, they go on the
spree till they have spent it all and can get no more credit, and then
unwillingly return to work. Camarines Sur possesses a wide expanse of
fertile soil in the valley of the River Bicol, in which are the Lakes
of Buhi and Bato, and the Pinag of Baao. The Bicol rises in the
province of Albay and runs through the whole length of Camarines Sur,
generally in a north-westerly direction, running into the great Bay of
San Miguel. It is navigable for small vessels up to the town of Nueva
C&aacute;ceres. Alligators abound here. A gap in the coast range gives
access to this valley from the port of Pasacao. The ground is level for
leagues around, yet from this plain two extinct volcanoes rear their
vast bulk, the Ysarog, 6500 feet high, and the Yriga, nearly 4000 feet
high. Camarines Sur contains more than five times as many inhabitants
as Camarines Norte, although not very different in area. Their
principal occupation is the cultivation of the extensive rice lands.
They also produce some hemp and a little sugar. Large quantities of
rice are exported to Manila, to Albay, and to Bisayas. Cattle are
raised in the island of Buri&aacute;s, which belongs to this province;
it also produces some palm sugar. This province is much richer than
either Tayabas or Camarines Norte.</p>
<p>The province of Albay is the southernmost and easternmost part of
Luzon, and is one of the richest and most beautiful regions of that
splendid island. The northern part, which commences at Punta Gorda on
the Bay of Lagonoy, is similar to the neighbouring Camarines Sur, as is
also the western part, about the shores of Lake Bato. A little to the
southward, however, the gigantic Mayon rears its peak 8000 feet into
the sky. The symmetry of this wondrous cone is but feebly rendered by
the photograph. Some of the most violent eruptions of this remarkable
volcano are mentioned under another heading in the Appendix.</p>
<p>On this volcanic soil, with the life-giving heat of the sun tempered
by frequent rains, the vegetable kingdom flourishes in the utmost
luxuriance. Tree-ferns, lianas, orchids, palms grow vigorously. On the
mountain slopes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200"
name="pb200">200</a>]</span>the <i>Musa textilis</i>, or abac&aacute;
plant, finds its most congenial habitat. Little rice is grown, the
inhabitants being mostly engaged in the more remunerative occupation of
planting and preparing this fibre.</p>
<p>A description of the manner of its preparation, with photographs of
the growing plants and of the apparatus for cleaning the fibre, will be
found under the description of the Vicols.</p>
<p>The island of Catanduanes belongs to Albay province, and its
characteristics and productions are the same. The configuration of the
province of Albay is most favourable to the production of this fibre.
The plant seems to require a light volcanic soil, a certain height
above the sea, and exposure to the Pacific breezes in order to
flourish.</p>
<p>To summarise the description of Luzon we may say that its
agricultural wealth, present and future, lies in the valley of the Rio
Grande of Cagayan, in the great valley lying between the Gulf of
Lingayen and the shores of the Bay of Manila, in the rich lands of
Cavite, Batangas, and Laguna, in the valley of the River Bicol, and on
the slopes of the volcanoes of Albay.</p>
<p>The production of the great northern valley is principally tobacco;
of the middle valley, sugar and rice; of the southern valley, rice, and
of the volcanic slopes, Manila hemp. The Sierras of Ilocos are highly
mineralised, as are also the mountains of Tayabas, whilst as already
stated washing for gold is the principal industry of Camarines Norte.
Parts of this great island, as in Bulacan and Pampanga, support a dense
population of 500 to the square mile; whilst, in other parts, hundreds
or even thousands of square miles are absolutely unknown, and are only
populated by a few scattered and wandering savages, many of whom have
never seen a white man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href=

<h2 class="main">Aetas or Negritos, Including Bal&uacute;gas,
Dum&aacute;gas, Maman&uacute;as, and Mangui&aacute;nes.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These people are generally considered to be the
aborigines of the Philippines, and perhaps at one time inhabited the
entire group. The invasion of the Malays dispossessed them of the
littoral, and of the principal river valleys, and the Spanish Conquest
drove them gradually back into the mountains. It seems strange that
these irreclaimable savages should be able from their eyries on Mount
Mariveles to distinguish a great city with its Royal and Pontifical
University and yet remain unconverted, uncivilised, and independent of
all authority, just as they were before Legaspi arrived.</p>
<p>They are a race of negroid dwarfs of a sooty black colour, with
woolly hair, which they wear short, strong jaws, thick lips, and broad
flat noses. The men I have seen in the jungle near Porac and at
Mariveles were about 4 feet 8 inches in height, and the women about a
couple of inches shorter. The men only wore a cord round the waist with
a cloth passed between their legs. The women wore a piece of cloth
around the hips, and as ornaments some strings of beads round their
necks. However, like many other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202"
href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>savages in the Philippines
and elsewhere, those of them, both men and women, who are accustomed to
traffic with the Christian natives, are possessed of clothes which they
put on whenever they enter a village. Their appearance was not
prepossessing; the skin of a savage is rarely in good order or free
from some scaly eruption, and the stomach is commonly unduly distended
from devouring large quantities of vegetable food of an innutritious
character. Still they were not so unpleasing as might be supposed, for
although their figures are not good according to our standards, nor are
their muscles well developed, either on arms or legs, yet there was a
litheness about them that gave promise of extreme agility and great
speed in running. As a matter of fact, they do run fast, and climb
trees in a surprising way. The Tagals and other Malays who go
barefooted use their toes to pick up an object on the ground rather
than stoop as a European would do, but the toes of the Negritos are
more like fingers. They come near the Quadrumanes in this respect. The
men carried bows, about five feet six inches long and a quiver full of
iron-pointed arrows&mdash;also a wood-knife, or <i>bolo</i>, very
roughly made. The former they make themselves; but the latter they
obtain from the Tagals. I can confirm from my own experience a
statement of various travellers, that they are fond of lying close to
fires or in the warm ashes, for when I arrived at a bivouac of these
people near Porac, their skins were covered with ashes, and I saw that
they had recently arisen from their favourite lair, the prints of their
forms being plainly visible. They had with them some wretched
starveling dogs which assist them in the chase.</p>
<p>It would seem that the Negritos must be descended from a race which
formerly extended over a vast area, for remains of them exist in
Southern India, in the mountains of Ceylon, and in the Andaman
Islands.</p>
<p>In the Malay Peninsula they are called Semang. From the description
of them given by Hugh Clifford, in his interesting book, &lsquo;In
Court and Kampong,&rsquo; they appear to be identical with the
Philippine Negritos. Crauford, in his &lsquo;History of the Indian
Archipelago,&rsquo; gives the measurement of a Negrito from the hills
of K&ecirc;dah as four feet nine inches. Mr. F. V. Christian, in a
paper recently read before the Royal Geographical Society, stated that
he had found tombs of Negritos on P&oacute;nap&eacute; one of the
Caroline group. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203"
name="pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Negritos build no houses, and are nomadic, in the sense of
moving about within a certain district. They live in groups of twenty
or thirty under a chief or elder, and take his advice about camping and
breaking up camp, which they do according to the seasons, the ripening
of jungle fruit, movements of game, etc. They seem to have great
reverence for their dead and for their burial-grounds, and apparently
dislike going far away from these places where they suppose the souls
of their ancestors are wandering. They bury their dead, placing with
them food and weapons for their use, and erect a rough shelter over the
graves.</p>
<p>It would be curious to learn the opinion of these poor savages on
the proceedings of some learned Teuton, prowling around their
graveyards in search of skulls and skeletons for the Berlin or Dresden
Ethnographical Museum.</p>
<p>They have no tribal organisation and even make war on other groups,
seeking victims for the death-vengeance. They are therefore unable to
assemble in large numbers; nor is it easy to see how they could subsist
if they did so. They put up rough sloping shelters against the sun and
wind, consisting of a framework of saplings or canes, covered with
coarse plaited mats of leaves which they carry with them when they move
their camp.</p>
<p>In Pampanga and Bataan, they are occasionally guilty of cattle
stealing, and even of murdering Christians, if a favourable opportunity
presents itself. In such a case an expedition of the Cuadrilleros of
the neighbouring towns is sent against them.</p>
<p>If they can be found, their bows and arrows are no match for the
muskets of the Cuadrilleros, and some of them are sure to be killed.
After a time peace is restored.</p>
<p>The trade for jungle produce is too profitable to the Christians for
them to renounce it, whatever the authorities may order.</p>
<p>The Negritos do not cultivate the ground but subsist on jungle
fruits and edible roots, their great luxury is the wild honey which
they greedily devour, and they barter the wax with the Christians for
rice and sweet potatoes. They also hunt the deer and wild pigs, and as
Blumentritt says, they eat everything that crawls, runs, swims, or
flies, if they can get it. They chew <i>buyo</i> like the Tagals and
other Malays, and are inordinately fond of smoking.</p>
<p>They are said to hold the lighted end of their cigars in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>their mouths, a thing I have seen done by the
negroes on the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
<p>They appear to have no religion, but are very superstitious. They
celebrate dances at the time of full moon, the women forming a ring and
the men another ring outside them, something like a figure in the
Kitchen Lancers. They move round to the sound of some rude musical
instruments in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Whether this performance is intended as a mark of respect to the
moon, or is merely held at the full for the convenience of the light, I
cannot say.</p>
<p>Several travellers have stated that they sacrifice pigs when it
thunders. As thunder-storms are very frequent and often of
extraordinary violence in the Philippines, this custom would imply the
possession of a large number of pigs on the part of the Negritos. Those
of Mariveles and of the Zambales mountains do not appear to possess any
domestic animals, except dogs, and they find it difficult to kill the
wild pigs, active as they are. Consequently, I think this must apply to
those Negrito tribes, such as the Bal&uacute;gas and Dum&aacute;gas, of
whose condition I shall speak later. They are also said to offer up
prayers to the rainbow. This offering can be made with greater ease
than the sacrifice of a pig, but the frequency of rainbows at certain
seasons will keep them pretty closely to their devotions.</p>
<p>Ratzel, &lsquo;History of Mankind,&rsquo; vol. i., p. 471, says:
Among the Negritos of Luzon, a fabulous beast with a horse&rsquo;s head
which lives in trees is venerated under the name of Balendik. And on p.
478: When killing an animal, the Negritos fling a piece heavenwards
crying out at the same time, &ldquo;This is for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They show great respect for old age, and the British War Office
might learn something from them for they are reported to tend with love
and care every old man of warlike repute.</p>
<p>Their language largely consists of curious clicks and grunts, and
those of them who trade with the Christians usually learn enough of the
local dialect to do the necessary bargaining.</p>
<p>There are some varieties of the Negritos who are more or less mixed
up with the Malays, but their origin is not clear.</p>
<p>The Malay women are very unprejudiced, perhaps there <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>are
no women on earth more ready to form temporary or permanent alliances
with foreigners: they do not disdain even the Chinamen. They perhaps do
not like them, but they know that John Chinaman makes a good husband,
provides liberally for his family, and does not expect his wife to do
any hard work.</p>
<p>By some writers the Malay women, notably the Visayas, are accused of
unbounded sensuality (Anto. de Morga. <span lang="es">Sucesos de
Filipinas</span>), but anyhow the Tagal women draw the line at
Negritos, and will have nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>Fray Gaspar de San Agustin however thought that the Visaya women
would not be so particular.</p>
<p>This being so, the hybrid races in Luzon must have sprung from the
union of Remontados&mdash;that is to say, of Malays who took refuge in
the hills either from a natural love for savage life, or as fugitives
from justice&mdash;with the Negrito women.</p>
<p>Amongst these varieties are the <i>Bal&uacute;gas</i>, who live in
the eastern cordillera of Nueva &Eacute;cija, in north and south
Ilocos, and in the mountains of Tayabas. Some of these people have
advanced a step in civilisation, they build huts and do a little rude
cultivation.</p>
<p>The <i>Dum&aacute;gas</i>, another hybrid race, occupy the eastern
slopes of the Sierra Madre from the northern frontier of El Principe
district to the Bay of Palanan, where the last Tagal village is
situated, the Tagals thinly peopling the shores. But from Palanan to
Punta Escarpada the whole coast is in the undisputed possession of the
<i>Dum&aacute;gas</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Dum&aacute;gas</i> keep up a friendly communication with the
few Christian villages near them, and do a small trade with them. They
even work on their lands and help in fishing for a small remuneration,
generally paid in cotton cloth.</p>
<p>They have no known religion, they marry without ceremony, and are
said to disregard the ties of kinship.</p>
<p>Those who live far from the Christian villages are said to be
entirely brutal and devoid of all virtue, for they will sell their own
children for a little rice. They are almost irreclaimable from their
savage and independent character.</p>
<p>Some of these <i>Dum&aacute;gas</i> live amongst the <i>Irayas</i>
and the <i>Catalang&aacute;nes</i>, two heathen and semi-independent
tribes showing signs of Mongolian blood, who occupy a considerable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>stretch of country in the province of Cagayan
between the Rio Grande and the Sierra Madre, say about twenty
geographical miles north and south of the 17th parallel. These
<i>Dum&aacute;gas</i> intermarry with the tribes they live amongst, and
have adopted their dress, religion, and customs.</p>
<p>The <i>Maman&uacute;as</i>, also a hybrid race, inhabit the
mountains of the north-east promontory of Mindanao. They are few in
number. There were, in 1887, four Jesuit mission stations amongst them,
three of which are on Lake Mainit, or Sapongan, as it is called on some
maps.</p>
<p>The <i>Mangui&aacute;nes</i>, who are probably a hybrid
Negrito-Visaya race, occupy almost the whole interior of Mindoro, up to
within two leagues of the coast. There are a few in the mountains of
Romblon and Tablas. There are three varieties of these people, those
residing near the western coast are much whiter, with lighter hair and
full beards.</p>
<p>Those living in the centre of the island are of a darker colour,
have sloping foreheads and less intelligence, while those of the
southern part, by their oblique eyes, aquiline noses and olive colour,
show signs of Chinese blood.</p>
<p>They are docile and do not fly from civilised man. A primitive
agriculture and the collection of jungle produce enables them to obtain
from the Christians, in exchange, rice, knives, bells, gongs, tobacco,
and buyo. They are not much advanced in religion, but are very
superstitious. They believe that the spirits of their ancestors and
relations never leave the places where they lived, but remain to
protect their descendants and families. There is noted amongst these
people a strong sense of morality and honesty, which unfortunately is
not recognised by their Christian neighbours, who are accustomed to
oppress them with the most exaggerated usury.</p>
<p>Since these words were written, Dean C. Worcester has published his
book on the Philippines, and amply confirms these remarks. He saw a
good deal of the <i>Mangui&aacute;nes</i>, and bears testimony to their
honesty and morality, and adds: &ldquo;On the whole, after making
somewhat extensive observations amongst the Philippine natives, I am
inclined to formulate the law that their morals improve as the square
of the distance from churches and other civilising
influences.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>He gives some particulars of their laws, and of their ordeals, which
are common to many of the Malays. There <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>are some
<i>Mangui&aacute;nes</i> in the Island of Palawan. They inhabit the
mountains in the interior of the southern part of the island, and
little is known about them, for the pirate races, or Mahometan Malays,
who occupy the coasts, keep a strict watch to prevent their
communicating with outsiders.</p>
<p>The few who have been seen by the Spaniards, are said to be
industrious, and physically similar to the <i>Tagbanuas</i>. Their
customs are said to be influenced by their constant intercourse with
the Mahometans. They were thought to number about 4000 in 1887, by Don
Felipe Canga Arguelles, the Governor of the Island. The Moors appear to
oppress the <i>Mangui&aacute;nes</i> of Palawan much as the Christian
natives do the <i>Mangui&aacute;nes</i> of Mindoro.</p>
<p>The illustration represents a <i>Negrito</i> from the Island of
Negros, a very favourable specimen of his race. He wears the head-dress
of a chief, and is armed with a bow and arrow of portentous length. His
figure, though not muscular, gives promise of great agility.</p>
<p>The <i>Negritos</i> of Palawan are few in number, and resemble those
of Mariveles. They use a piece of cloth, made of the inner bark of a
tree as their only garment. They call this the Saligan. They inhabit
the upper parts of the mountains between Babuyan and Barbacan, say from
10&deg; to 10&deg; 20&prime; N. latitude. They do a little agriculture
in a primitive fashion. The men clear the land, the men and women
together do the planting, and the women alone the reaping.</p>
<p>Their arms are bows and arrows, and the only education of the young
is in archery, which is taught them by their mothers from their
earliest infancy.</p>
<p>They are said to be generous, hospitable, and inoffensive, but
extremely revengeful if they are ill-treated. They have no religion,
but perform certain ceremonies from time to time. Canga-Arguelles
computed them to number about 500 in 1887.</p>
<p>The only use the <i>Negritos</i> can be to the United States will be
as a subject of study for the elucidation of problems in ethnography,
and to furnish skeletons for the museums. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most important race in the Archipelago is the
Tagal, or Tagalog, inhabiting Central Luzon, including the following
provinces:&mdash;</p>
<p>Batangas, Bulacan, Bataan, Camarines Norte, Cavite, Laguna, Manila,
part of Nueva &Eacute;cija and Tayabas, the districts of Infanta,
Morong, and part of Principe, also the Island of Corregidor and the
coast of Mindoro. They probably number about one million five hundred
thousand souls.</p>
<p>Antonio de Morga, in his work &lsquo;Sucesos de Philipinas,&rsquo;
says (p. 126): &ldquo;The women wear the b&aacute;ro and saya, and
chains of gold upon their necks, also bracelets of the same. All
classes are very clean in their persons and clothing, and of good
carriage and graceful (<i lang="es">de buen ayre y
gracia</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>They are very careful of their hair, washing it with gogo and
anointing it with ajonjoli oil<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7377src"
href="#xd20e7377" name="xd20e7377src">2</a> perfumed with musk.</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;Relacion de las Islas Philipinas,&rsquo; 1595 (?), the
anonymous author said of the Tagals: &ldquo;The people of this province
are the best of all the Islands, more polite, and more truly our
friends. They go more clothed than the others, the men as well as the
women. They are light-coloured people of very good figures and faces,
and like to put on many ornaments of gold, which they have in great
abundance.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>In other respects, however, they seem, from the same author, to be
less worthy of praise, for he goes on to tell us: When some principal
man died, in vengeance of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209"
href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>death they cut off many
heads, with which they made many feasts and dances.... They had their
houses full of wood and stone idols, which they called Tao-tao and
Lichac, for temples they had none. And they said that when one of their
parents or children died the soul entered into one of these idols, and
for this they reverenced them and begged of them life, health, and
riches. They called these idols <i>anitos</i>, and when they were ill
they drew lots to find which of these had given them the illness, and
then made great sacrifices and feasts to it.</p>
<p>They worshipped idols which were called Al Priapo Lacapati, Meilupa,
but now, by the goodness of God, they are enlightened with the grace of
the Divine Gospel and adore the living God in spirit.</p>
<p>The old writer then remarks on the cleverness and sharpness of the
boys, and the ease with which they learned to read and write, sing,
play, and dance.</p>
<p>This characteristic appears general to the Malay race, for, speaking
of the Javanese, Crauford says: They have ears of remarkable delicacy
for musical sounds, are readily taught to play upon any instrument the
most difficult and complex airs.</p>
<p>According to Morga, at the time of the Conquest, the Tagals wrote
their language in the Arabic character. He says: They write well in
these Islands; most people both men and women, can write. This tends to
show that the equality of the sexes, which I shall refer to later, has
been customary from ancient times.</p>
<p>Tomas de Comyn (1810) says:</p>
<p>The population of the capital, in consequence of its continual
communication with the Chinese and other Asiatics, with the sailors of
different nations, with the soldiers, and with the Mexican convicts who
are generally mulattoes, and who arrive in some number every year, has
come to be a mixture of all the bloods and features, or otherwise a
degeneration of the primitive race.</p>
<p>At Cainta, on a branch of the Pasig, the natives are darker, taller,
and of a different type. This is accounted for by the fact that, in
1762&ndash;63, during the English invasion, a regiment of Madras Sepoys
occupied the town for many months, long enough, in fact, to modify the
native type to such an extent as to be plainly visible 125 years
later.</p>
<p>Crauford says that some Christian inhabitants of Ternate followed
their priests (Jesuits) to Luzon when the Spaniards <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>were
driven out of Molucas by the Dutch in 1660. They were located in
Marigondon. There is now a town called Ternate between Marigondon and
the sea, near Punta Restinga. But, with the exception of the capital
and these two places, I think the Tagals have not greatly altered in
physical characteristics since the Conquest&mdash;notwithstanding
Ratzel&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;Spanish-Tagal half-breeds in the
Philippines may be numbered by the hundred thousand,&rdquo; which I
consider erroneous.</p>
<p>The fact is, that wherever a small number of male Europeans live
amongst a native race, the effect on the type is smaller than may be
supposed, and what there is becomes obliterated or disseminated in
course of time. Colour may be a little altered, but all the other
characteristics remain. The mestizas are not so prolific as the native
women, and notwithstanding Jagor&rsquo;s assertion to the contrary,
they often marry natives, and especially if their father has died while
they were young. I knew in the town of Balayan three handsome sisters,
daughters of a Spaniard who had died many years before. Although they
lived in a house which had been at one time the finest in the town, and
still retained some remnants of its former grandeur, they had reverted
entirely to the native customs and dress. They spoke only Tagal, and
all three of them married natives.</p>
<p>The tendency of the Philippine native to revert to old customs is
well marked, and I agree with Jagor when he says: &ldquo;Every Indian
has an innate inclination to abandon the hamlets and retire into the
solitude of the woods, or live isolated in the midst of his own
fields,&rdquo; in fact to <i>Remontar</i>.</p>
<p>The Tagals are considered by Wallace as the fourth great tribe of
the Malay race. He only mentions the Tagals, but in fact the population
of the Archipelago, except the Negritos and some hybrids, belongs to
the Malay race, although slightly mixed with Chinese and Spanish blood
in a few localities. They are here and there modified by mixture with
other races, and everywhere by their environment, for they have been
Roman Catholics and subject to Spanish influence, if not rule, for
upwards of three centuries.</p>
<p>They differ little in physical appearance from the Malays proper
inhabiting the Peninsula, and although their manners and customs are
somewhat changed, their nature remains <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>the same. They retain
all the inherent characteristics of the Malay.</p>
<p>The Tagal possesses a great deal of self-respect, and his demeanour
is quiet and decorous. He is polite to others, and expects to be
treated politely himself. He is averse to rowdiness or horse-play of
any kind, and avoids giving offence.</p>

<h3 class="main">Characteristics&mdash;Family Life.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For an inhabitant of the tropics he is fairly
industrious, sometimes even very hard working.</p>
<p>Those who have seen him poling <i>cascos</i> against the stream of
the Pasig will admit this.</p>
<p>He is a keen sportsman, and will readily put his money on his
favourite horse or game-cock; he is also addicted to other forms of
gambling. The position taken by women in a community is often
considered as a test of the degree of civilisation it has attained.
Measured by this standard, the Tagals come out well, for amongst them
the wife exerts great influence in the family, and the husband rarely
completes any important business without her concurrence.</p>
<p>Crauford considers the equality of the sexes to be general
throughout the Indian Archipelago, more particularly in the Island of
Celebes, where the inhabitants are the most warlike of all.</p>
<p>The Tagals treat their children with great kindness and forbearance,
those who are well-off show much anxiety to secure a good education for
their sons, and even for their daughters.</p>
<p>Parental authority extends to the latest period in life. I have seen
a man of fifty years come as respectfully as a child to kiss the hands
of his aged parents when the vesper bell sounded, and this
notwithstanding the presence of several European visitors in the
house.</p>
<p>Children, in return, show great respect to both parents, and come
morning and evening to kiss their hands. I may remark that their manner
of kissing is different to ours. They place the nose and lips against
the cheek or hand of the person to be saluted, and draw in the breath
strongly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=

<h3 class="main">Appearance&mdash;Manners.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Malays in general are not, perhaps, a handsome
race, their flat noses disfigure them in the eyes of the
recently-arrived European or American, and it takes time to get
accustomed to them.</p>
<p>Still, their rich brown skin often covers a symmetrical, lithe and
agile figure, the small hands and feet denoting their Turanian
origin.</p>
<p>The youth of both sexes up to the age of puberty are not seldom of
striking beauty, and their appearance is not belied by their behaviour.
They are trained in good manners from their earliest youth, both by
precept and example.</p>
<p>Palgrave says of them: &ldquo;Nowhere are family bonds closer drawn,
family affections more enduring, than amongst the Malay races.... His
family is a pleasing sight, much subordination and little restraint,
unison in gradation, liberty not license. Orderly children, respected
parents, women subject, but not suppressed, men ruling, but not
despotic, reverence with kindness, obedience in affection, these form a
lovable picture, nor by any means a rare one in the villages of the
Eastern Isles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may here be interesting to note the very contradictory opinions
that have been expressed upon this subject.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">John Foreman.</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;The Philippine Islands,&rsquo; p. 194.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home discipline and training of manners are quite ignored,
even in the well-to-do families. Children are left without control, and
allowed to do just as they please, hence they become ill-behaved and
boorish.<span class="corr" id="xd20e7481" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">W. G. Palgrave.</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Malay Life in the Philippines,&rsquo; p. 146.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd20e7492" title=

than is ordinary elsewhere at their age.<span class="corr" id=
"xd20e7495" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>
<p>As will be seen in my text, my own experience rather confirms
Palgrave&rsquo;s opinion, and I should say that even the children of
the peasantry would compare favourably both in manners and intelligence
with the children at the Board Schools in London, and to say nothing of
Glasgow or Liverpool.</p>
<p>Amongst the Tagals, it is customary when speaking of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>or
to a man to use the prefix Si&mdash;thus Si Jos&eacute;, Mr.
Joseph&mdash;whilst a woman is spoken of or to as Aling Maria, Miss
Mary. The word Po is used for Sir. Thus: &Oacute;o-po&mdash;Yes, sir;
Hind&iacute;-po&mdash;No, sir; Uala-po&mdash;There is none, sir;
Mayro&oacute;m-po&mdash;There is some, sir.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Cleanliness.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sense of personal dignity and self-respect, the
dominant feeling in the Malay nature, is shown in the Tagals by a
general cleanliness in their persons and clothing. They usually live
near water, and nearly all of them can swim.</p>
<p>The heat of the climate makes bathing a pleasure, and as the
temperature of the sea or river is commonly 83&deg;F., a prolonged
immersion causes no inconvenience.</p>
<p>On the morning of a feast-day the number of bathers is increased,
and at the time of high tide, a very large proportion of the population
seems to be in the water, both sexes and all ages mixing
indiscriminately, the adults decently covered and all behaving
themselves as decorously as the bathers at Brighton, Newport, or
Atlantic City.</p>
<p>They have not yet arrived at that precise stage of civilisation that
develops the Rough, the Larrikin, or the Hooligan. Palgrave says: A
Malay may be a profligate, a gambler, a thief, a robber, or a murderer,
he is never a cad.</p>
<p>Palgrave had not great opportunities of knowing the Tagals, but I
confirm the above opinion, although I do not agree with the views on
the future of the Philippines, and what is best for them, expressed in
his fantastic and hyphen-infested verbiage, all seemingly written for
effect.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Superstitions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Tagal is extremely superstitious, and like his
kinsman, the Dayak, he is a believer in omens, although he has not
reduced them so completely to a system, and three centuries of
Christianity have diverted his superstitions into other channels.</p>
<p>In his mind, each cave, each ravine, each mountain, each pool, each
stream, has its guardian spirit, to offend or to startle which may be
dangerous. These are the jinni of Southern Arabia and Socotra.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Balete tree (<i>Ficus Urostigima</i>&mdash;Sp.) corresponds to
our Witch Elm, and certainly at night has a most uncanny appearance.
Each of these great trees has its guardian spirit or Tic-balan.</p>
<p>Daring, indeed, would be the Indian who would pass such a tree,
enter a cave, ascend a mountain, or plunge into a pool without bowing
and uttering the <span lang="tl">Pasing tabi sa nono</span> [By your
leave, my Lord] that may appease the spirit&rsquo;s wrath, just as the
Bedouin of Dhofar cry, &ldquo;Aleik Soubera&mdash;aleik soubera,&rdquo;
to propitiate the jinni.</p>
<p>His mental attitude in this respect reminds me of a story told me
many years ago by a lady residing in Hampshire. A lady neighbour of
hers inquired from her whether she taught her children to bow when the
Devil&rsquo;s name was mentioned. My informant replied in the negative,
whereupon the lady remarked, &ldquo;I do, I think it is safer.&rdquo;
This is the way with the Tagal, he bows because he thinks it is safer.
If that prudent lady is still alive and may chance to read this, she
may be pleased to learn that her opinion is shared by the whole Malay
race.</p>
<p>Child-birth has its anxieties everywhere, and the more artificial
the life the woman has led, the more she suffers at that critical time.
The Tagal woman whose naturally supple frame has never been subjected
to tight-lacing, nor compressed within a tailor-made costume, has a far
easier time of it than her European sister, but superstition and
quackery combine to terrify and ill-use her.</p>
<p>The <i>Patianac</i>, an evil spirit, profits by the occasion, and
his great delight is to obstruct the birth, or to kill and devour the
infant. The patianac might be busy elsewhere, but from the ridge-pole
of the house a bird of ill-omen, the dreadful Tic-tic, raises a warning
cry, for its office and delight is to call the attention of the evil
spirit to the opportunity of doing mischief. Instantly every door and
window is closed and every chink stopped to prevent its entrance,
whilst the anxious father and his kinsmen, naked as they were born,
walk around and underneath the house, slashing the air with sticks or
<i>bolos</i> to frighten away the spirit. Sometimes a man will get up
on the ridge-pole to drive away the Tic-tic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the stifling room, it is too often the case that
violent means are used to expedite the birth, so violent indeed, that
they sometimes result in the permanent injury or in the death of the
woman. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some years ago the Government instituted an examination for
midwives, and only those were allowed the practice who had been
properly instructed, so that these absurdities and cruelties are on the
wane, except amongst the poorest or in outlying districts.</p>
<p>The <i>As&uacute;an</i> is merely a cannibal ghost, but the Tagal
ghost throws stones, a thing I have not heard of a ghost doing in
Europe.</p>
<p>All sorts of stories are told about the <i>As&uacute;an</i>, similar
to ghost stories in other lands.</p>
<p>About 1891 a house in Malate was stoned night after night, and
although every effort was made to find out the authors, they were never
discovered, and the natives steadfastly believed it to be the doing of
the <i>As&uacute;an</i>.</p>
<p>There is another superstitious idea firmly rooted in the minds of
the Tagals and other natives, of which the following is an instance: A
villainous-looking native had been captured with some property stolen
from my house, and was sent to the lock-up at the police station, from
whence he promptly escaped, but was recaptured later. My coachman, a
most meritorious servant who had been with me for years, assured me in
an impressive manner, and with an air of conviction, that the culprit
was one of those wizards who are able to pass through a keyhole by
drawing themselves out into the thinness of a piece of string, and my
other servants accepted this view implicitly.</p>
<p>The famous <i>Tulisanes</i> or bandits, thoroughly believe in the
power of the <i>Antin-Antin</i> or amulet to render them invulnerable
to bullets. It is, indeed, remarkable that notwithstanding the numbers
of these criminals who have been shot by the Guardia Civil with their
<i>Antin-Antin</i> upon them, this absurd belief should flourish, but
there is no doubt it does. These charms consist of any sort of
necromancers&rsquo; rubbish, or are sometimes writings in invocations,
usually worn round the neck under the clothing.</p>
<p>The profession of the Roman Catholic religion has perhaps helped
this superstition to linger on, for the wearing of scapularies is
common, especially amongst the women. These articles are manufactured
for the priests and some are sent out to Antipolo, to be blessed at the
shrine of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Buen Viage y de la Paz, and sold to
the pilgrims who crowd in thousands to this shrine in May of each
year.</p>
<p>A Tagal woman sometimes wears as many as three of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>these scapularies hung from silk threads round
her neck and covered by her upper garment. They usually dispose two in
front, where they conceive the danger is greatest, and one on the back,
as a further precaution against an attack from the rear.</p>
<p>Wearing these holy amulets, and having crossed herself and uttered a
prayer before coming downstairs in the morning, the Tagal wife or maid
feels that she has done all she can, and that if any backsliding should
occur, during the day, it will not be her fault.</p>
<p>She believes greatly in lucky or holy numbers&mdash;I heard the
following story related by a native lady to a native priest when going
to Batangas by steamer.</p>
<p>The lady was telling the priest of her husband&rsquo;s illness (it
appeared to have been congestion of the lungs), and she prepared and
applied a poultice of three heads of garlic in honour of the Three
Persons of the Blessed Trinity; this not producing the desired effect,
she then made a poultice of five heads of garlic, in honour of the Five
Wounds of our Blessed Saviour, and successively others of seven heads,
in honour of the Seven Pains of the Blessed Virgin; twelve heads in
honour of the Twelve Apostles, and last of all a poultice of
thirty-three heads of garlic in honour of the Thirty-three years our
Blessed Saviour remained on earth. The priest had nodded approval as
she went on, but as she stopped he said: &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; To
which the lady replied, &ldquo;Then he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This poor man came off easily, for in some cases people who suffer
from fits and other diseases are thought to be possessed by devils, and
are severely beaten to drive out the evil spirit. The patient does not
always escape with his life.</p>
<p>The women often dream of lucky numbers in the Manila Lottery and
make every endeavour to purchase the number they have dreamt of.</p>
<p>Amongst the Christian superstitions may be mentioned the feast of
San Pascual Bail&oacute;n at Obando. Those who attend this function are
commonly the rowdier class of inhabitants of the Capital, and they go
mostly on foot, making music and dancing on the way. They also dance in
the courtyard in front of the church, not forgetting to refresh
themselves with strong drink in the meanwhile.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Tagal Girl wearing Scapulary.</p>
<p class="first xd20e1984">[<i>To face p. 216.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This is not at all an edifying spectacle, for the dancers are
covered with dust and with the perspiration from their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>active exertions. I do not know the legend that
gives occasion to this curious form of devotion. Occasionally, and
especially during Holy Week, another form of penitence is practised by
the natives. I remember, about 1892, seeing one of these penitents, a
man having a mask on his face, the upper part of his body bare, and a
long chain fastened to one ankle and dragging on the ground behind him.
In one hand he bore a flagellum with which he from time to time lashed
himself on the shoulders, which bore evident marks of the discipline
they had received. A youth who followed him occasionally jerked the
chain, throwing the penitent violently at full length upon the dusty
road. This form of penitence is not approved, however, by the priests,
for when I called on the parish priest, the same evening, I mentioned
the circumstance to him, and he directed the penitent to be locked up,
to stop what he rightly termed a scandal.</p>
<p>On many occasions the natives had got up a religious excitement, and
great gatherings have taken place at some spot where a miraculous
appearance of the Blessed Virgin, or some supernatural manifestation
has been alleged to have occurred.</p>
<p>All these affairs have been somewhat sceptically inquired into by
the priests under a general order to this effect issued by the
archbishop, and so far as my experience goes, the excessive religious
ardour of the natives has rather been checked than stimulated.</p>
<p>When writing about the Visayas I shall have more to say about
misdirected religious zeal. The Tagals practise circumcision as a
hygienic measure, and not as a religious rite. The operation is usually
performed at the age of fourteen by a companion or friend of the
patient, and a sharp flint or piece of volcanic glass (obsidian) is
used for this purpose. From what I have heard, this custom is really
maintained by the women, who refuse their favours to the uncircumcised
of their own nation, though with foreigners they are more
complaisant.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Cursing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In cursing, the Tagal displays a directness quite
worthy of the Anglo-Saxon. All his remarks are very much to the point,
and would have earned the approval of the late lamented and reverend
author of the Ingoldsby Legends. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218"
href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>Leaving out the world-wide
reflections upon the virtues of an opponent&rsquo;s female ancestry,
since these appear to belong indiscriminately to all nations, the
principal Tagal curses are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1. May an evil wind blow upon you.</li>
<li>2. May the earth open and swallow you up.</li>
<li>3. May the lightning strike you.</li>
<li>4. May the alligator eat you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The superiority of the Tagal style as compared with the French
Mortbleu, Ventre bleu, must be apparent to all unprejudiced observers.
The Tagal has drawn all his curses from the grand and awful operations
of nature in his own country, except the last, where he invokes the
dreaded saurian, the most fearsome inhabitant of the Philippine swamps,
rivers, and coasts&mdash;formerly venerated by his ancestors and
respectfully addressed by them as <i>nono,</i> or grandfather.</p>
<p>Under American guidance and example, I think the Tagals quite
capable of developing a startling vocabulary of swear-words, and in
course of time rivalling their instructors in profanity, with a touch
of their old style to give a little local colour.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Courtship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Courtship is sometimes a long business amongst the
Tagals. It is still customary in the country districts for the
impecunious candidate for matrimony to serve the father of the damsel
he desires to wed for a period which may extend to a couple of years or
more. He is called a <i>Catipado</i>, and is expected to make himself
generally useful, and to take a hand in any labour that may be going
on, sowing or reaping, mending the roof, or patching the canoe.</p>
<p>It is his privilege to assist the girl of his choice in her labours.
The girls of a household are expected to husk the rice for the next
day&rsquo;s use. This is done in the cool of the evening, out of doors,
a wooden mortar and long heavy pestle being used. It is a
well-recognised occasion for the lover to assist and entertain his
sweetheart.</p>
<p>Very pretty do the village maidens look, as, lightly clothed in
almost diaphanous garments, they stand beside the mortars plying the
pestle, alternately rising on tiptoe, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb219" href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>stretching the lithe
figure to its full height and reach, then bending swiftly to give force
to the blow.</p>
<p>No attitude could display to more advantage the symmetry of form
which is the Tagal maiden&rsquo;s heritage, and few sights are more
pleasing than a group of these tawny damsels husking paddy midst chat
and laughter, while a tropical full moon pours its effulgence on their
glistening tresses and rounded arms.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Marriage.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But let us return to the <i>Catipado</i>. He must be
very careful not to give cause of offence to the elders of the family,
more especially towards the end of his term, as there may be a
disposition amongst them to dismiss him, and take on another to begin a
new term. In fact, many natives have shown themselves so unwilling to
consent to their daughter&rsquo;s marriage, when no sufficient reason
could be given for their refusal, that the Governor-General,
representing the Crown, is entrusted with a special power of granting
the paternal consent in such cases.</p>
<p>No regular marriage can be celebrated whilst the girl is a minor,
without the father&rsquo;s consent.</p>
<p>When this is refused, and the patience of the lovers is exhausted,
the girl leaves her father&rsquo;s house and is deposited in the house
of the fiscal, or churchwarden, under the care of his wife.</p>
<p>A petition on stamped paper is then prepared, reciting the
circumstances; this goes to the parish priest and to the
Gobernadorcillo, who require the father to state the grounds of his
refusal. If they are satisfied that no good reason exists, the
petition, with their approval noted on it, goes to the
Governor-General, and in due time a notification appears in the
official Gazette that the Governor-General has been pleased to overrule
the father&rsquo;s negative, and a license (on stamped paper also) for
the marriage to be celebrated, is delivered to the priest. This
procedure is very necessary, but it has the disadvantage of being slow
and expensive, so that in some cases, instead of adopting this course,
the youthful pair allow themselves some advances of the privileges of
matrimony, and perhaps there arrives a time when the obdurate parent
finds himself obliged to consent to legalise an accomplished fact to
avoid an open scandal. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href=
"#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span></p>
<p>The erring damsel, however, may think herself lucky if she escapes a
fatherly correction laid on with no grudging hand, before the reluctant
consent is granted.</p>
<p>The priest will of course require the youthful sinners to confess
and do penance for their previousness before he will marry them.</p>
<p>The marriage ceremony is a very simple one, and usually takes place
after early Mass. The priest fixes the fee according to the means of
the party; it is often a substantial one. After the ceremony comes a
<i>Catap&uacute;san</i> or assembly, when the relatives and friends are
entertained. There will be music, and unless the priest disapproves of
dancing, that will be indulged in. The Augustinians mostly allow
dancing, but the Dominicans often object to it as an immoral
amusement.</p>
<p>The house will be hung with bright-coloured cloths and paper
lanterns; the table loaded with refreshments, both light and heavy.</p>

<h3 class="main">Wedding Feasts.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Roast pig is a standing dish at these feasts, the
animal being roasted whole, on a spit over a fire made on the ground. A
professional roaster superintends the operation, and the pig is brought
to a fine even colour all over. Sometimes there are roast turkeys or
roast mutton and kid, possibly beef cooked in various ways, surely fish
of different kinds, fresh, salted, or smoked; the indispensable boiled
rice or <i>morisqueta</i>, and an abundance of sweets, fruits in syrup,
guava jelly, and Dutch cheese. There will be chocolate and perhaps
coffee. As to drinks, besides some native brews, there will be
Norwegian or German export beer, or Tennant&rsquo;s beer in stone
bottles, square-face gin, and Spanish red wine (Vino Tinto).</p>
<p>Unlimited Buyo, cigarettes and cigars are provided. All these things
are hospitably pressed upon all comers, especially upon any European
present. If his politeness prevents his refusing this miscellaneous
assortment, unless he is favoured with the digestion of an ostrich, he
will rue it next day, and perhaps for several days. The worthy priest
is naturally in the place of honour, and like the wise man he mostly
is, he perhaps brings, slung under his habit, or sends beforehand, a
capacious leather bottle, with a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221"

direct from some convent vineyard on the peninsula, a pure natural
wine, undefiled and unfortified by German industrial spirit. A tall and
portly Augustine monk, in his spotless and ample white robes, presents
a very imposing and apostolic appearance, and looks quite in his place
at the head of the table. The host seldom sits down with his guests,
but busies himself attending to their wants. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Tagals as Soldiers and Sailors.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The houses of the well-to-do natives are large and
airy, and are kept scrupulously clean under the vigilant eye of the
mistress.</p>
<p>Hospitality is a characteristic of the Tagal. According to his means
he keeps open house on religious feast-days or on family festivals, and
readily invites to his table at any time travellers who may be passing
through the town. Having enjoyed their hospitality on many occasions, I
can testify to their kindness and liberality. They placed at my
disposal their riding-ponies, vehicles or canoes, and did all in their
power to show me anything remarkable in their neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Tagals make good soldiers, and can march long distances
barefooted. Morga remarks how quickly they learned to use the arquebus
or musket in the wars of the conquest. They gave proofs of their pluck
and endurance when assisting the French in Tonquin. If well led they
will advance regardless of danger; when once engaged they become
frenzied and blood-thirsty, most difficult to restrain. They are not
improved by being made to wear gloves, boots, helmets, and European
uniforms.</p>
<p>In this they are not singular, for the Ceylon Rifle Regiment (a
Malay corps) was utterly ruined, and never did any good after being put
into boots and gloves by some narrow-minded martinet.</p>
<p>As sailors they are unsurpassed in the East. They navigate their
schooners and lorchas with much skill, although the rigging and outfit
is seldom kept in thorough good order unless they have a Spanish
captain.</p>
<p>They serve both as sailors and firemen in the fine flotilla of
coasting-steamers belonging to Manila, and they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>manned all the smaller vessels of the Spanish
Navy in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Most of the British and foreign steamers in the far East carry four
Manila men as quarter-masters. They are considered to be the most
skilful helmsmen. Their ability as mechanics is remarkable. They bear
out entirely Morga&rsquo;s description of them: &ldquo;Of good talent
for anything they undertake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They will, without any European supervision, heave down wooden
sailing-vessels up to about 1000 tons, and repair the keel, or strip,
caulk, and re-copper the bottom. I have often seen this done. They
build from the excellent hard wood of the country, brigantines,
schooners, lorchas, also <i>cascos</i>, and other craft for inland
navigation and shallow waters. These latter vessels are most
ingeniously contrived, and admirably adapted to the conditions under
which they are to be used, and although not decked, carry their cargoes
dry, and in good order, in the wettest weather. They make the most
graceful canoes, and paddle or punt them with remarkable dexterity.</p>
<p>In Manila and Cavite are to be found a fair number of native
engine-fitters, turners, smiths and boiler-makers.</p>
<p>There must be some 400 steam sugar-mills in the islands (besides
6000 cattle-mills). The engine-drivers and firemen are all natives, and
mostly Tagals.</p>
<p>There are also in the capital large numbers of native
house-carpenters, quarrymen, stone-masons, and some brick-layers and
brick-makers.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, foundry work is not much done by Tagals, although
when Legaspi arrived in Luzon he not only found cannon mounted at
Manila, but there was a cannon-foundry there, and another at Tondo.</p>
<p>There are foundries at the latter place to this day belonging to
Chinese half-castes, but church bells are more to their way now than
cannon. They, however, cast small brass mortars with handles like quart
pots, which are used for firing salutes at the feasts of the church.
But I think most of the workmen were then, and are now, Chinese.</p>
<p>They make their own gunpowder, and fireworks of all kinds. They are
inordinately fond of these, and get up very creditable displays. They
are careless in handling them, and I was eye-witness of an explosion of
fireworks during a water <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, on the passing in front of
the governor&rsquo;s palace at Malaca&ntilde;an, when a number of
people were killed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224"
name="pb224">224</a>]</span>I never learned how many had perished, and
the newspapers were forbidden to enlarge upon it.</p>
<p>Excellent carriages are built in Manila entirely by native labour,
the <i>carromatas</i>, or two-wheeled vehicles used for travelling,
being made in the suburbs, or in Malabon.</p>
<p>Carriage-building is an important trade, for an incredible number of
vehicles of all sorts are used in Manila.</p>
<p>Of an evening, in the Luneta, some hundreds may be seen, and on one
occasion, at the races of the Jockey Club in Santa Mesa, two thousand
vehicles were reported to be present.</p>
<p>Painting and decorating is executed by Manila men in excellent
style. This art was taught them by Alberoni, and other Italians. Their
pupils have covered the walls of many buildings with frescoes in the
Italian style, very fairly done. There is much scope for their art in
decorating altars and shrines.</p>
<p>The Tagals also show some talent for sculpture, as any visitor to
Manila can see for himself by inspecting the Jesuit Church, which is a
marvel of patient artistic labour, having taken eleven years to
construct. Some of the carving there, however, is so delicate and
minutely detailed, that it appears more suitable for a show case in a
museum than for the adornment of a place of worship. Of course, every
detail of design is due to the Jesuits themselves, amongst whom
talented men of every profession can be found.</p>
<p>As a fisherman, the Tagal excels, and the broad expanse of Manila
Bay, some 700 square miles in area, gives ample scope for his
ingenuity. He practises every kind of fishing <i>Corrales de Pesca</i>,
or fish-stakes within the five-fathom line, casting nets and seines in
the shallow water, huge sinking nets attached to bamboo shear-legs
mounted on rafts in the estuaries, drift nets and line-fishing in the
deeper parts of the bay.</p>
<p>From Tondo, from Para&ntilde;aque, Las Pi&ntilde;as, Bacoor, and
Cavite Vi&eacute;jo, and from dozens of other villages, go hundreds of
large canoes, crowded with men, and heaped up with nets, to fish near
the San Nicolas Bank, or about Corregidor Island, and they often return
with large catches. Some fish by night, with torch and spear; in fact,
they seem to be quite at home at any kind of fishing.</p>
<p>The nets and sails of the canoes, and the clothes of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>fishermen, are all tanned by them with the bark
of the camanchile tree.</p>
<p>The salting, drying, or smoking of the fish caught in the bay is
quite an extensive business. The smoked sardines, or
<i>tinap&aacute;</i>, are very tasty, as also the pickled mullet roes
called <i>Bag&oacute;n de Lisa</i>. But the small shrimps fermented in
a jar, and brought to a particular stage of putrefaction,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e7775src" href="#xd20e7775" name="xd20e7775src">1</a>
much appreciated by the natives, will not suit European or American
tastes.</p>
<p>The vast Bay of Manila holds fish and mammals of all sorts and
sizes, from small fry to that huge but harmless monster of the deep,
<i>Rhinodon tipicus</i>, with a mouth like the opening of a hansom cab,
scooping in jelly-fish by the bushel.</p>
<p>The p&eacute;je-rey, like a smelt, the lengu&aacute;do, or sole, the
l&iacute;sa, or mullet, the bac&oacute;co, corb&iacute;na,
p&aacute;mpano, and others whose names I have forgotten, are excellent.
The oysters are good, but very small. Prawns are excellent, large and
cheap. Crabs are good, but large ones are not plentiful. Clawless
lobsters are caught amongst the rocks of Corregidor and Mariveles. The
largest turtle I have ever seen was caught off Malabon. It can be seen
in the Jesuits&rsquo; Museum, Manila.</p>
<p>Sharks of all sorts, enormous saw-fish,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7787src" href="#xd20e7787" name="xd20e7787src">2</a> hideous
devil-fish,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e7790src" href="#xd20e7790" name=
"xd20e7790src">3</a> and monstrous conger eels, as well as poisonous
black and yellow sea-snakes, abound, so that the fisherman does not
have everything his own way. Amongst these men are to be found some
excellent divers. I have found them quite able to go down to the keel
of a large ship and report whether any damage has been done. Where a
sheet of copper has been torn off, they have nailed on a new sheet,
getting in two or three nails every time they went down. I enquired
from one of these men who had frequently dived for me, when a European
diver with diving-gear could not be obtained, if he was not afraid of
sharks? He answered, &ldquo;No es hora del tiburon&rdquo;&mdash;it is
not the sharks&rsquo; time&mdash;and I found he considered that he was
very fairly safe from the sharks between ten and four. Before ten and
after four was a dangerous time, as the sharks were on the look-out for
a meal. I cannot say that I should like to trust to this, especially as
I have seen sharks about at other times, and one afternoon, in the bay,
had to keep off a hammerheaded-shark <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>from coming near a
British diver who was examining the rudder of a steamer, by firing at
it from the stern. Some sharks are heavy and slow-moving creatures, but
the hammer-headed kind are endowed with a surprising activity, and
twist and turn like an eel.</p>
<p>My native diver informed me that he was much more afraid of the
<i>Manta</i> than of any shark, and that once when he was diving for
some purpose&mdash;I do not recollect when&mdash;at the bottom a shade
fell on him, and, on looking up, he beheld an enormous manta right
above him&mdash;in his words, &ldquo;as big as a lighter.&rdquo;
However, it passed on, and he was able to regain the surface.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most remarkable talent possessed by the Tagal is his
gift for instrumental music.</p>
<p>Each parish has its brass band supplied with European instruments,
the musicians generally wearing a quasi-military uniform. If the
village is a rich one, there is usually a string band as well. They
play excellently, as do the military bands. Each infantry battalion had
its band, whilst that of the Peninsular Artillery, of ninety
performers, under a band-master holding the rank of lieutenant, was one
of the finest bands I have ever heard. There were few countries where
more music could be heard gratis than in the Philippines, and for
private dances these bands could be hired at moderate rates.</p>
<p>The Tagal is also a good agriculturist. According to his lights, he
cultivates paddy with great care. It is all raised in seed-plots, the
soil of which is carefully prepared, and fenced about. The fields are
ploughed and harrowed whilst covered with water, so that the surface is
reduced to soft mud. When the ground is ready for planting, the whole
population turns out, and, being supplied with the young shoots in
bundles, of which tally is kept, proceed to plant each individual shoot
of paddy by hand.</p>
<p>Ankle-deep in the soft mud of the paddy-fields stand long rows of
bare-legged men, women and children, each in a stooping position,
holding against the body with the left hand a large bundle of
rice-plants, incessantly and rapidly seizing a shoot with the right
hand, and plunging it into the black slime with the forefinger
extended.</p>

</div>
<p>Hour after hour the patient toil goes on, and day after day, in all
the glare of the burning sun, reflected and intensified from the
surface of the black water, till the whole vast surface has been
planted. The <i>matandang-sa-naya</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>or village elder,
then announces how many millions of rice shoots have been put in. The
labour is most exhausting, from the stooping position, which is
obligatory, and because the eyes become inflamed from the reflection of
the sun on the black water. As the paddy is planted during the rainy
season, it often happens that the work is done under a tropical
downpour instead of a blazing sun.</p>
<p>When driving along a road through paddy-fields in October, it seems
incredible that every blade of that luxuriant crop has been
transplanted by hand. Yet the people who do this are branded as lazy. I
think that they are quite ready to work for a sufficient inducement.
Whenever I had works to execute I never experienced any difficulty in
obtaining men. I made it a rule to pay every man with my own hands
every Saturday his full wages without deductions. On Monday morning, if
I wanted 300 men, there would be 500 to pick and choose from. I should
like to see some of their depreciators try an hour&rsquo;s work
planting paddy, or poling a casco up stream.</p>
<p>The undulating nature of the ground renders it necessary to divide
paddy land into small plots of irregular outline at varying levels,
divided from each other by ridges of earth called
<i>pil&aacute;piles</i>, so as to retain the rain or irrigation water,
allowing it to descend slowly from level to level till it reaches its
outlet at the lowest point. The Tagals fully justify their Turanian
origin by the skill and care which they show in irrigation. About
Manila, the <i>sac&aacute;te</i>, or meadow-grass, which is the
principal food of the thousands of ponies in the city, is cultivated on
lands which are exactly at a level to be flooded by the
spring-tides.</p>
<p>The mango-tree is carefully cultivated, and the fruit is, to some
extent, forced by lighting fires of leaves and twigs under these trees
every evening in the early part of the year to drive off insects, and
give additional warmth.</p>
<p>In Batangas and La Luguna, and, to some extent, in Bulacan, the
Tagals cultivate the sugar-cane successfully.</p>
<p>But where they really shine, where all their care is lavished, where
nothing is too much trouble, is in the cultivation of the buyo (Piper
betel). This is a climbing plant, and is grown on sticks like hops.
There were many plantations of this near Pineda, which I frequently
visited. It is grown in small fields, enclosed by hedges or by rows of
trees to keep off the wind.</p>
<p>The soil is carefully prepared, and all weeds removed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>As
the tendrils grow up, the sticks are placed for them. The plants are
watered by hand, and leaf by leaf carefully examined every morning to
remove all caterpillars or other insects. The plants are protected from
the glare of the sun by mat-shades supported on bamboos.</p>
<p>The ripe leaves are gathered fresh every morning, and taken to
market, where they find a ready sale at remunerative prices for chewing
with the areca nut, and a pinch of slaked shell lime.</p>
<p>Whenever I have had Tagal hunters with me deer-shooting, I have been
struck with their knowledge of the natural history of their locality.
They thoroughly understood the habits of the game, and almost always
foretold correctly the direction from which the deer would approach the
guns.</p>
<p>They have names for every animal and bird, and for the different
ages or conditions, or size of antlers, of the deer.</p>
<p>Even insects and reptiles are named by them; they could give details
of their habits, and knew whether they were poisonous or dangerous.</p>
<p>They always showed themselves greatly interested in sport, and much
appreciated a good shot. They spoke of a gun that killed well as a
<i>hot</i> gun (baril ma&iacute;nit). If they were trusted with a gun
they were very reluctant to spend a cartridge unless for a dead
certainty. If two cartridges are given to a hunter, he will bring in
two deer or pigs, otherwise he will apologise for wasting a cartridge,
and explain how it happened.</p>
<p>Their usual way of taking game is to set strong nets of abaca in the
woods in the form of a <span class="xd20e7860">V</span>, then the
beaters and dogs drive the game towards the hunters, who are concealed
near the apex, and who kill the deer or wild pigs with their lances
whilst entangled in the nets.</p>
<p>I have found the Tagals very satisfactory as domestic servants,
although not so hard-working as the Ilocanos. Some of them could clean
glass or plate as well as an English butler, and could lay the table
for a dinner party and ornament tastefully with flowers and ferns,
folding the napkins like a Parisian waiter.</p>
<p>They could also write out the <i>m&eacute;nu</i> (their orthography
having been previously corrected), and serve the dinner and wines in
due sequence without requiring any directions during the meal.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some of them remained in my service the whole time I was in the
Philippines; one of them, Paulino Morillo, came to England with me in
charge of my two sons, and afterwards made three voyages to Cuba with
me. I gratefully acknowledge his faithful service. His portrait is
appended.</p>
<p>I did not find them sufficiently punctual and regular as cooks, nor
did they make their purchases in the market to as much advantage as the
Chinese cooks, who never bid one against another to raise the
price.</p>
<p>As clerks and store-keepers I found the Tagals honest, assiduous,
and well-behaved. As draughtsmen they were fairly skilful in drawing
from hand sketches, and excelled in copying or tracing, but were quite
untrustworthy in taking out quantities and computing. Some of them
could write beautiful headings, or design ornamental title-pages. I
have by me some of their work that could not be done better even in
Germany or France. But the more skilful they were the more irregular
was their attendance, and the more they had learned the worse they
behaved.</p>
<p>When doing business with the Tagals, I found that the elder men
could be trusted. If I gave them credit, which was often the case, for
one or two years, I could depend upon the money being paid when due,
unless some calamity such as a flood or a conflagration had rendered it
absolutely impossible for them to find the cash. In such a case (which
seldom happened) they would advise me beforehand, and perhaps bring a
portion of the money, giving a <i>pagar&eacute;,</i> bearing interest,
for the remainder, and never by any possibility denying the debt. I
never made a bad debt amongst them, and gladly testify to their
punctilious honesty. This idea of the sacredness of an obligation seems
to prevail amongst many of the Malay races, even among the pagan
savages, as I had occasion to observe when I visited the
Tagban&uacute;as in Palawan (Paragua). They certainly did not learn
this from the Spaniards.</p>

<h3 class="main">The More Instruction the less Honesty.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When dealing with the younger men who had been
educated in Manila, in Hong Kong, or even in Europe, I found that this
idea had been eradicated from them, and that no sufficient sense of
honour had been implanted in its stead.</p>
<p>In fact, I may say that, whilst the unlettered agriculturist,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>with his old-fashioned dress, and quiet,
dignified manner, inspired me with the respect due to an honest and
worthy man, the feeling evolved from a discussion with the younger and
educated men, dressed in European clothes, who had been pupils in the
Aten&eacute;o Municipal, or in Santo Tom&aacute;s, was less favourable,
and it became evident to me that, although they might be more
instructed than their fathers, they were morally below them. Either
their moral training had been deficient, or their natures are not
improved by education. I usually preferred to do business with them on
a cash basis.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Unsuitable Training.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Dare I, at the tail-end of the nineteenth century, in
the days of Board Schools, County Councils, conscientious objectors,
and Hooligans, venture to recall to mind a saying of that grand old
Conservative, the Peruvian Solomon, Tupac Inca Yupanqui? &ldquo;Science
should only be taught to those of generous blood, for the meaner sort
are only puffed up, and rendered vain and arrogant by it. Neither
should such mingle in the affairs of state, for by that means high
offices are brought into disrepute.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e7905src" href="#xd20e7905" name="xd20e7905src">4</a></p>
<p>That great monarch&rsquo;s words exactly express my conclusions
about the young Tagals and other natives.</p>
<p>To take a young native lad away from his parents, to place him in a
corrupted capital like Manila, and to cram him with the intricacies of
Spanish law, while there is probably, not in all those who surround
him, one single honest and upright man he can look up to for guidance
and example, is to deprive him of whatever principles of action he may
once have possessed, whilst giving him no guide for his future
conduct.</p>
<p>He acquires the European vices without the virtues; loses his native
modesty and self-respect, and develops too often into a contemptible
<i>pica-pleito</i>, or pettifogger, instead of becoming an honest
farmer.</p>
<p>The more educated Tagals are fond of litigation, and with the
assistance of native or half-caste lawyers will carry on the most
frivolous and vexatious lawsuit with every artifice that cunning and
utter unscrupulousness can suggest. The corrupt nature of the Spanish
courts is a mainstay to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>such people. Although they may be
possessed of ample means litigants often obtain from the court
permission to sue a foreigner in <i>forma pauperis</i>.</p>
<p>They are unscrupulous about evidence, and many will perjure
themselves or bring false witnesses without shame. It is said that
blank stamped paper of any year can be obtained for a sufficient price
for the purpose of forging documents relating to the sale of land; as
there are people who regularly keep it for this purpose.</p>
<p>The feeling of envy is strong within them, and any Spaniard or
foreigner who appears to be succeeding in an industrial enterprise in
the provinces, such as planting or mining, is sure, sooner or later, to
be attacked by the pettifoggers or their men of straw, and he will be
bled heavily when he comes before the courts, and perhaps have to go to
the Court of Appeal or even to the Tribunal Supr&eacute;mo in Madrid
before he can obtain a verdict in his favour.</p>
<p>The credulity of the Tagal is remarkable; he has on occasion given
way to outbursts of ferocity, involving death and destruction to
numbers of innocent people.</p>
<p>In 1820, during an epidemic of cholera, he was led to believe that
this strange sickness had been produced by the foreigners, who had
poisoned the water. An indiscriminate massacre of foreigners was the
consequence of this calumny, and but few escaped. The authorities,
always prompt to repress uprisings against the Government, allowed time
for the foreigners to be massacred before they interfered. It is not
easy to say how many English, French, or Americans met their deaths at
the hands of the populace, for such details are never allowed to be
published.</p>
<p>I may say, however, that one should not be too hard on the Tagals
for this crime, since at a much later date a massacre of priests
occurred in Madrid, on account of a similar belief. It was started
because a lad, the servant of a priest, was seen to throw some white
powder into the Fuente Castellana. I have not at hand the details of
this massacre, but the friars were slaughtered like pigs.</p>
<p>In the dreadful epidemic of cholera in 1882, the natives behaved
very well, and I must give General Primo de Rivera credit for keeping
strict order and promptly organising the construction of temporary
hospitals, the inspection of every parish of the city, the conveyance
of the sick to hospital, and the burial of the dead. It was done under
military direction, and with the assistance of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>priests, the civil authorities, and the
principal inhabitants. No disturbances occurred owing to the strong
hand of the Governor-General, although some of the evil-disposed
natives began to murmur about the doctors carrying about the
disease.</p>
<p>The mortality was dreadful; I believe that some 30,000 people lost
their lives in the city and province of Manila in three or four months.
In order to nurse the sick and bury the vast number of dead, it was
necessary to employ the convicts and prisoners. All these people
behaved remarkably well, although many succumbed to the disease. The
survivors were pardoned outright, or had their sentences reduced. If
the Governor-General had shown signs of weakness, the horrors of 1820
might have been repeated.</p>
<p>To give a better idea of the credulity of the Tagals and other
natives, I may say that in 1868 telegrams were received in Manila
(<i>vi&acirc;</i> Hong Kong), which were made public in the islands,
announcing the Spanish revolution of September, and the news, with
stupendous exaggerations, reached the remotest villages and the most
miserable huts. A general and indelible idea took possession of the
minds of the natives that Revolution (they thought it was a new emperor
or a great personage) had decreed that all were equal, that there
should be no difference between Indians and Spaniards, that the latter
had to return to Spain and Indians be substituted in all employments,
and that the tribute would be greatly reduced. That there would be no
conscription nor <i>corv&eacute;e</i> (personal work), that the Pope
would name several Indian bishops, and that the Spanish priests would
return to the Peninsula. That a new captain-general would arrive who
would marry a native lady, who would be made a princess, that their
children would be kings and sovereigns of the Philippine Empire.</p>
<p>All this was confirmed by prophecies, by dreams, and revelations,
and great miracles by the Virgin of Antipolo and of St. Joseph, and
other patrons of the Indies, not omitting St. Peter, for whom the
native clergy profess a profound veneration, and who is the patron
saint of a brotherhood which has caused much trouble in the
Philippines.</p>
<p>General G&aacute;ndara, informed of all these absurdities by the
friars, did not fail to appreciate the immense importance of the
movement which, like the teachings of the so-called gods of Panay and
Samar who collected thousands of followers, might produce a general
insurrection. He therefore <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href=
"#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>took due precautions, and invited
all the Spaniards in the Philippines, without distinction of party, in
support of the Government constituted in Spain. There was, however,
much agitation and much travelling to and fro amongst the native clergy
and the pettifogging lawyers. It was, however, not till 1872 that the
conspirators succeeded in producing the mutiny of Cavite, which was
quickly suppressed, with much slaughter of the mutineers.</p>
<p>The chief amusement of the Tagal is cock-fighting. I shall not
describe this well-known sport, but will remark that it provides no
inconsiderable revenue. The right of building and running the cock-pits
of each province is farmed out to Chinese or Chinese half-breeds, and
no combats may take place except in these places. They are opened after
Mass on Sundays and feast-days, and on some other days by special leave
from the authorities. The love of this sport and the hope of gain is so
general that the majority of the natives of Manila are breeders of
game-cocks, which they tend with assiduous care, and artisans often
carry their favourite birds to their work and tether them in the shade,
where they can keep them in view. Horse-fights occasionally take place.
The ponies of the Philippines, although not usually vicious to man,
will fight savagely with each other, and inflict severe bites. I
remember a case where two ponies harnessed to a victoria began fighting
and a Guardia Civil attempted to separate them, when one of the ponies
seized him by the thigh, lifted him off his feet, and shook him as a
terrier might shake a rat; the flesh of the man&rsquo;s thigh was torn
away and the bone left bare. This dreadful wound caused his death. The
occurrence took place in front of the church of Binondo in Manila. Bull
fights have been an utter failure in Manila, although many attempts
have been made to establish them. Flying kites is a great amusement
with young and old in the early months of the year, when the N.E.
monsoon blows. Fights are organised: the competing kites have
crescent-shaped pieces of steel attached to the tails, and the
competitor who can cut the string of his opponent&rsquo;s kite by
causing his own to swoop suddenly across it, is the winner. Betting on
the result is common. The Tagals are also fond of the theatre, and some
years ago there was a Tagal theatre in Binondo where comedies in that
language were played. I have also met strolling players in the country
towns. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p>But of all kinds of shows a good circus is the one that fetches his
last dollar out of the Tagal. Guiseppe Chiarini reaped a silver harvest
in Manila on both occasions he pitched his tents there. His advance
agent, Maya, a Chilian, paved the way for success, and the pompous
announcement that Chiarini was born in the sacred city of Rome, greatly
impressed the natives, who flocked in thousands to his circus. Chiarini
considered himself able to tame the most vicious horse, and purchased a
fine Manila pony that no one could manage. The beast, however, was not
subdued by his powers, and, seizing the tamer&rsquo;s cheek, bit off a
large piece.</p>
<p>On feast days in the larger towns, open-air plays are sometimes
given, and what with preparations, rehearsals, and performance, absorb
the attention of a large number of the inhabitants for a couple of
months. I witnessed a very notable performance of this kind some years
ago at Balayan in the province of Batangas, the characters being played
by the sons and daughters of the principal people there. The subject
was taken from the &lsquo;Wars of Grenada.&rsquo; In the first act we
saw a Christian king and his court, also his only and peerless
daughter. After these had had their say, an ambassador from the Moslem
king was announced, and the king summoned his council to consider the
communication. He took his seat upon the throne, with grey-bearded
councillors on each side. The Moslem envoy, and his suite and escort,
entered on horseback and very unnecessarily galloped about and gave an
exhibition of their horsemanship. Then the envoy, still on horseback,
harangued the king, and arrogantly demanded the hand of the beauteous
princess for his master, threatening war to the knife in case of
refusal. He then retired to his camp.</p>
<p>Next came the discussion of the demand which the grey-beards think
it hopeless to resist. The Moslem envoy was sent for, and amid great
grief the princess was about to be confided to his care, when there
rushed in a young Christian warrior and his followers, who swore they
would never allow a Christian princess to wed a Paynim, and dismissed
the envoy with contumelious remarks. He retired vowing vengeance. All
this occupied a long time, and I did not remain for the rest. I think
it took two days to act. But from the volleys of musketry and firing of
rockets and mortars which I heard, a sanguinary war must have been
waged and many of the characters must have perished. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>The
play was acted in a more spirited way than usual; some of the male
performers declaimed their parts with energy. Some were mounted on fine
ponies, and were well got up and armed.</p>
<p>The girls&rsquo; dresses were rich, and they wore a great deal of
jewellery. Some of the princesses were very handsome girls. There is a
sort of a superstition that any girl performing in one of these pieces
is sure to be married within a year. This makes them very ready to
undertake a part, as they obtain an excellent opportunity to display
their charms to advantage, and so help to fulfil the prediction. The
play was witnessed by the mass of the population of Balayan and by
numerous visitors from the neighbouring towns. It was considered a very
successful performance, and it carried my memory over the wide Pacific
to Peru, where I have seen similar plays acted by the country people in
the Plaza of Huacho.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Tagal literature does not amount to very much, and the
policy of the Government of late years has been to teach Spanish as
well as the native dialects in the schools. This did not meet the
approval of the old school of priests; but many of the younger ones
have accepted the Government view. In the Exhibition of the
Philippines, Madrid, 1887, Don Vicente Barrantes showed twenty volumes
of grammars and vocabularies of the Philippine dialects, and thirty-one
volumes of popular native poetry, besides two volumes of native plays.
The Reverend Father Raimundo Lozano exhibited twenty-eight volumes of
religious works in the Visayas-Panayano dialect, and the Reverend
Father Francisco Valdez a study of the roots of the Ilocan dialect in
manuscript. Many works in the native dialects have been written by the
Spanish priests, such as one by the Reverend Father Manuel Blanco, the
learned author of the &lsquo;Flora Filipina,&rsquo; of which I give the
title and the first verse:&mdash;</p>

this gives the reader sufficient idea of the language.</p>
<p>There is much that is good in the Tagal, much to like and admire.
Antonio de Morga, Sinibaldo de Mas, Tom&aacute;s de Comyn, Paul de la
Gironi&egrave;re, Jagor, Bowring, Palgrave, Foreman, Stevens,
Worcester&mdash;all have some good to say of him, and with reason. But
the piratical blood is strong in him yet. He requires restraint and
guidance from those who have a higher standard for their actions than
he has. Left to himself he would infallibly relapse into savagery. At
the same time he will not be governed by brute force, and under
oppression or contumelious treatment he would abandon the plains,
retire to the mountains, and lead a predatory life. Although not just
himself nor truthful, he can recognise and revere truth and justice in
a master or governor. Courageous himself, only a courageous man can win
his respect. He is grateful,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8025src" href=

reverence and gratitude will have no trouble in leading him.</p>
<p>I have testified to the Tagal&rsquo;s excellence in many handicrafts
and callings, yet I greatly doubt whether they have the mental and
moral equipment for any of the professions. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>I
should not like to place my affairs in the hands of a Tagal lawyer, to
trust my life in the hands of a Tagal doctor, nor to purchase an estate
on the faith of a Tagal surveyor&rsquo;s measurement.</p>
<p>I do not say that they are all untrustworthy, nor that they can
never become fit for the higher callings, but they are not fit for them
now, and it will take a long time, and a completely changed system of
education, before they can become fit.</p>
<p>What they want are examples of a high type of honour and morality
that they could look up to and strive to imitate. There are such men in
America. Whether they will be sent to the Philippines is best known to
Mr. McKinley. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Pampangos are close neighbours of the Tagals. They
inhabit the rich and fertile province of Pampanga and a large part of
that of Tarlac. There are also some detached colonies of them in the
towns of Bata&aacute;n, Nueva &Eacute;cija, Pangasin&aacute;n, and
Zambales. The population of Pampanga is given in the census of 1876 as
226,000. Allowing one-half the population of Tarlac to belong to this
race, we have to add 41,000, and supposing one-tenth the population of
Bata&aacute;n, Nueva &Eacute;cija, and Zambales, to be Pampangos, say
27,000, we get 294,000 as their number in 1876. Doubtless they have
largely increased since then. The Pampangos speak a different language
from the Tagals, yet they can understand each other to some extent.
Many of the better class speak both languages. The Pampango does not
greatly differ from the Tagal in appearance or character, but his
environment and his occupations are different. He is not so much a
sailor, a fisherman, or a mechanic. He excels in agriculture, is a good
organiser of labour, rides well, is a good hunter, and makes a bold and
determined soldier. Large numbers of this war-like race have fought
under the Spanish flag against the Mahometan princes of the Moluccas,
of Mindanao, and Sulu, as also against the British and the Dutch.
<i>Pampangos as Cultivators.</i></p>
<p>The towns of San Fernando, Gu&aacute;gua Bacolor, Mexico, Angeles,
Candaba, and many others have been built up by Pampanga industry. They
contain many fine houses, where the European traveller is sure of a
hospitable reception.</p>
<p>The staple crop of Pampanga is sugar, and I shall <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>explain their organisation for its cultivation
and manufacture.</p>
<p>In Luzon the land is usually cultivated under an arrangement known
as <i>Aparceria</i>.</p>
<p>The conditions of <i>Aparceria</i> vary according to the locality,
and to established custom, since on the land near a town a smaller
share is given to the cultivator than on land near the forests, where
if he were not satisfied he might commence to clear land for himself.
Also the land near the towns is more valuable than that at a distance
for various reasons.</p>
<p>The following is an example of the terms usual in Pampanga. The
land-owner provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Cleared land ready for the plough.</li>
<li>B. Sugar-cane points for the first planting.</li>
<li>C. Sugar-mill, boiling-pans and the building for same.</li>
<li>D. Money advances to keep the cultivator and his family, and for
taking off the crop.</li>
<li>E. Carts for carrying the cane to the mill.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cultivator, or <i>inquilino</i>, provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. His labour and that of his family for ploughing, planting and
cultivating the cane and fencing the plantations.</li>
<li>2. The ploughs and implements of husbandry.</li>
<li>3. The cattle (water buffaloes) for the above labours and for
working the mill if it is a cattle mill.</li>
</ul>
<p>The money advanced to the cultivator by the land-owner is charged 20
per cent. per annum interest.</p>
<p>For a daily task of 9 pilones from cattle-mills or 10 pilones from
steam-mills there are employed:</p>

<h3 class="main">Sugar Crop.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The land-owner pays the men&rsquo;s wages, and the
cultivator gives them three meals a day and cigars.</p>
<p>The sugar-moulds (pilones) cost about 12&frac12; cents each, and the
cost is divided between the parties.</p>
<p>In making up the account, 6&frac12; per cent. per annum is charged
on the value of the land, machinery and building.</p>
<p>The molasses which drains from the sugar belongs to the
land-owner.</p>
<p>These pilones are supposed to contain 140 lbs. of sugar when filled.
They are placed upon a small pot to allow the molasses to drain off.
When delivered their weight may be from 112 to 120 lbs. according to
the time they have been draining. This sugar polarises about 80 per
cent. according to circumstances and requires to be treated at the
<i>farderias</i> in Manila to bring it up to an even sample before it
is exported. The sugar loaves are cut up, sorted, crushed, mixed with
other sugars, sun-dried, and a certain quantity of sand added before
being put into bags for export as <i>Manila Sugar</i>, usually No. 7 or
No. 9 Dutch standard. It will be seen from the above figures how
moderate the expenses are. Of course each land-owner has a number of
cultivators, and often a number of mills.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the low price of sugar which has prevailed for many
years, the provinces of Pampanga has made money out of it as the
handsome houses of the land-owners in all their towns testify.</p>
<p>The sugar crop in Pampanga has never quite reached a million
pilones, but has exceeded nine hundred thousand, say from fifty to
sixty thousand English tons. The cane is crushed in small steam or
cattle mills having three horizontal rollers.</p>
<p>These mills are mostly made in Glasgow and have now in Pampanga
entirely superseded the Chinese mills with vertical rollers of granite
or the native mills with vertical rollers of hard wood.<a class=

</div>
<p>In former years I pointed out, in a report written for General
Jovellar, what a great advantage it would be to Pampanga if the
planters would abandon the use of pilones <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>and make sugar
suitable for direct export and so obviate the manipulation in the
<i>farderias</i> at Manila.</p>
<p>They could make a sugar similar to that produced in Negros and known
as Ilo-ilo.</p>
<p>Now that the Philippines have passed into the hands of the United
States, I do not doubt that central sugar factories will be established
and will turn out centrifugal sugars polarizing 96 per cent. similar to
the Cuban sugar.</p>

<h3 class="main">Pampangos as Fishermen.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are some Pampanga fishermen on the River Betis,
at San Jos&eacute;, and amongst the labyrinth of creeks and mangrove
swamps forming the north-western shores of Manila Bay.</p>
<p>Their avocation is not destitute of danger, for these swamps are the
home of the alligator.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e8212src" href=
"#xd20e8212" name="xd20e8212src">2</a> Although they are not as large
as some I have seen in the River Paraguay or on the River D&aacute;ule,
in Ecuador, they are quite large enough to seize a horse or a man. I
was once visiting Fr. Enrique Garcia, the parish priest of
Macab&eacute;be, when a native woman came in and presented him with a
dollar to say a Mass in thanksgiving for the escape of her husband from
death that morning. She told us that he was pushing a shrimp-net in
shallow water when the buaya seized him by the shoulder. The fisherman,
however, called upon his patron saint, and putting out his utmost
strength, with the aid of Saint Peter, succeeded in extricating himself
from the reptile&rsquo;s jaws and in beating him off. His shoulder,
however, was badly lacerated by the alligator&rsquo;s teeth. It was
lucky for him that he was in shallow water, for the alligator usually
holds its prey under water and drowns it.</p>
<p>The Pampangos also fish on the Rio Grande, the Rio Chico, and in the
Pinag de Candaba. This latter is an extensive swampy plain, partly
under cultivation in the dry season, partly laid out as fish-ponds.</p>
<p>The Nipa palm grows in abundance in the delta of the B&eacute;tis,
and small colonies of half-savage people are settled on dry spots
amongst these swamps engaged in collecting the juice or the leaves of
this tree. The stems are punctured and the juice runs into small
vessels made of cane. It is collected daily, poured into jars and
carried in small canoes to the distillery where it is fermented and
distilled. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span></p>
<p>The distilleries are constructed in a very primitive manner, and are
worked by Chinese or Chinese half-breeds.</p>
<p>The produce is called Vino de Nipa, and is retailed in the native
stalls and restaurants.</p>
<p>The leaves are doubled and sewn with rattan strips upon a small
piece of bamboo, they are taken to market upon a platform laid across
the gunwales of two canoes. This arrangement is called <i lang=
"es">bangcas mancornadas</i>, canoes yoked together. The nipa is sold
by the thousand, and serves to thatch the native houses anywhere,
except in certain parts of Manila and other towns where its use is
forbidden on account of the great danger of its taking fire.</p>
<p>From circumstances that have come under my own observation, I
believe it to be a fact that when trade in nipa thatch is dull, the
canoe-men set fire to the native houses in the suburbs of Manila to
make a market. I have noticed more than once that houses have commenced
to burn from the upper part of the thatched roof where they could not
have caught fire accidentally. The Province of Pampanga extends to the
westward, as far as the crests of the Zambales mountains, and the
Cordillera of Mabanga is included within its boundaries. There is but
little cultivated land beyond the town of Porac to the westward. Here
the Pampangos trade with the Negritos, who inhabit the Zambales range,
getting from them jungle produce in exchange for rice, tobacco, sugar,
and other articles. Occasionally the Negritos steal cattle from the
Pampangos or at times murder one of them if a good opportunity presents
itself.</p>

<h3 class="main">Pampangos as Hunters.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The natives of this part of the province are good
wood-men and hunters.</p>
<p>In addition to taking game by nets and ambuscade, some of them hunt
the deer on ponies which are trained to run at full speed after the
game, up or down hill, and to get near enough for the rider to throw or
use his lance.</p>
<p>Being at Porac in 1879 with the late Major Deare, 74th Highlanders
(now 2nd Batt. Highland Light Infantry), an enthusiastic sportsman, we
saw two men who had practised this sport for years, and were told that
their arms, ribs, legs and collar-bones had been broken over and over
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>again. We saw them gallop down a rocky and
precipitous descent after a deer at full speed.</p>
<p>We could only wonder that they were alive if that was a sample of
their hunting. Their saddles were fitted with strong martingales and
cruppers and with triple girths so that they could not shift. The
saddles themselves were of the usual native pattern, like miniature
Mexicans. The men were light weights.</p>
<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;If any reader of this contemplates travelling in
the Philippines, let him take a saddle with him. It should be as small
as he could comfortably use, and light. The ponies are from twelve to
thirteen hands high, but are remarkably strong and clever. I know from
experience that a good one will carry fourteen stone over rough ground
with safety.</p>

<p class="first">Pampanga has produced some notable bandits or
<i>Tulisanes</i> who have given the Spaniards much trouble. Of late
years there has been a diminution in the number of crimes of violence,
due in a great measure to the establishment of the Guardia Civil by
General G&aacute;ndara in 1867.</p>
<p>I once built a nipa house on the banks of the Rio Grande, near
Macab&eacute;be, and resided there for several months, carrying on some
works. I was new to the country and ignorant of the customs of the
people.</p>
<p>There were no other Europeans in the vicinity, except the
priests.</p>
<p>I took care to treat all my native neighbours with strict justice,
neither infringing their rights, nor allowing them to impose on me.</p>
<p>There came to stay with me Mr. A. B. Whyte, then an employ&eacute;,
now a partner in one of the leading British firms in Manila, who
frequently had ten thousand dollars in gold in his safe, and similar
sums were remitted to him from Manila at different times for the
purchase of sugar.</p>
<p>One day we received a visit from an officer of the Civil Guard who
came to warn us that we were in danger of an attack, that his post was
too far off for him to protect us, and that the locality bore a very
bad name for crimes of violence. We thanked him for his visit and
warning, entertained him to lunch, and informed him that we intended to
remain, after which he returned to his post at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>Apalit. On making inquiry we found that some of
our immediate neighbours were well-known bandits, but were thought to
have retired from business. However, they never attacked us, and
probably prevented any other Tulisanes from doing so lest they should
get the blame. But had I encroached on their land or treated them
contemptuously, or had I allowed them to impose upon me, I do not doubt
we should have been attacked and to say the least we might have found
ourselves in a tight place.</p>
<p>A nipa house is no place to defend, for it can be burnt in a few
minutes in the dry season, and a spear can be pushed through the sides,
or up through the floor with ease.</p>
<p>In cases like this one cannot entirely depend upon the assistance of
native servants, for they have sometimes joined with criminals to rob
or murder their master.</p>
<p>There is a curious custom amongst bandits to invite an outsider to
join them in a particular enterprise, and it is considered mean and as
denoting a want of courage to refuse, even when a servant is invited to
help rob or kill his master. Moreover, there is much danger in refusing
to join the bandits, for it will give dire offence to them and perhaps
have fatal consequences. This invitation is called a <i>Convite</i>
[<i>see</i> <a href="#ch5">Chap. V.</a>].</p>
<p>The hereditary taint of piracy in the Malay blood, and the low moral
standard prevailing in the Archipelago, as well as fear of the
consequences of a refusal, render it more difficult than a stranger can
realise for a native servant to resist such a temptation.</p>

<h3 class="main">Pampanga Women.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The women in Pampanga are smart in appearance, clever
in business, and good at a bargain, whether buying or selling. The men
are well aware of this and when selling their produce or buying a
sugar-mill, they like to have the assistance of their wives, who are
always the hardest customers to deal with.</p>
<p>They are excellent sempstresses and good at embroidery. In some
villages they make very durable silk handkerchiefs with coloured
borders of blue, red or purple. Straw hats, mats, <i>salacots</i>,
cigar and cigarette cases are also made by them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>Their houses are kept clean, and the larger ones are well-suited for
entertainments, as the <i>sala</i> and <i>caida</i> are very spacious,
and have polished floors of <i>narra</i>, or some other hard
close-grained wood very pleasant to dance on.</p>
<p>A ball at a big Pampanga house is a sight that will be remembered.
Capitan Joaquin Arn&eacute;do Cruz of Sul&iacute;pan, on the Rio
Grande, a wealthy native sugar-planter, used to assemble in his fine
house the principal people of the neighbourhood to meet royal or
distinguished guests. One of his daughters is married to a
distinguished lawyer, my friend Don Felipe Buencamino, author of the
remarkable State paper addressed to the United States Senate, and
published in the Congressional Record of January 9th, 1900, pp.
752&ndash;53&ndash;54. Capitan Joaquin possessed a magnificent
porcelain table-service of two hundred pieces, specially made and
marked with his monogram, sent him by a prince who had enjoyed his
hospitality.</p>
<p>He gave a ball for the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia, who afterwards
declared that the room presented one of the most brilliant sights he
had ever seen.</p>
<p>This from a son of an Emperor might seem an exaggeration, but
brilliant is the only word that can describe the effect produced on the
spectator by the bright costumes and sparkling jewellery of the
women.</p>
<p>Their dress seems to exercise a fascination upon Europeans which the
costume of any other eastern country fails to do.</p>
<p>Monsieur Paul de la Gironi&egrave;re, in his charming book,
&lsquo;Vingt Ans aux Philippines,&rsquo; says, about the Mestiza dress:
&ldquo;Nothing so charming, so <i>coquet</i>, so provocative as this
costume which excites to the highest point the admiration of all
strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He goes on to say that the women are well aware of this, and that on
no account would they make a change. I will add my opinion that they
are quite right, and may they ever stick to the saya, the b&aacute;ro,
and the tapis under the Stars and Stripes, may they ever be as natural,
as handsome and as prosperous as when the writer dwelt amongst them on
the banks of the Rio Grande under the paternal rule of Alcalde Mayor
Don Jos&eacute; F&eacute;c&eacute;d y Temprado. <span class=

<h2 class="label">Chapter XXVI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">Zambales (3).</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Zambales are a small and unimportant tribe of the
Malay race, with some admixture of Negrito blood. They inhabit part of
the province of Zambales from the River N&aacute;ja down to South
Felipe, a coast village in 15&deg; N. latitude, and in their mountains
there roam a good many Negritos. The Zambales are subjugated and
converted to Christianity, but some still maintain a partial
independence amongst the mountains, paying, however, the
&ldquo;<span lang="es">Reconocimentio de Vassallaje</span>.&rdquo; At
the time of the conquest, these people were famous head-hunters, and
otherwise manifested a bloodthirsty disposition. They lived in villages
of thirty to forty families, quite independent of each other, and their
chiefs possessed but little influence. When one of a family died the
surviving male relatives put on a black head-cloth or turban, which
they durst not remove until one of them had killed some one else so as
to satisfy the death vengeance. A murder could be atoned for by a
payment in gold or in goods, or a slave or Negrito might be delivered
up to be sacrificed to the <i>manes</i> of the departed. It was
customary amongst them to take with them to their feasts the heads or
skulls they possessed. The heads were placed on poles and ceremonial
dances were performed around them. They also emulated the Vikings by
making drinking cups out of their enemies&rsquo; skulls.</p>
<p>Their religion was similar to that of the Tagals. Their principal
god was called Malayari, but he had under him two deputy gods, Acasi
and Manglobag, and a large number of inferior gods. Their chief priest
was called Bayoc, and exercised great influence amongst
them<span class="corr" id="xd20e8339" title="Source: ,">.</span> They
celebrated baptism with the blood of a pig. Amongst them, as in Borneo
and with many tribes of Malays who are not Mahometans, the pig is
considered as the most acceptable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247"
href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>sacrifice to the gods. For
particulars about this I refer the reader to &lsquo;Life in the Forests
of the Far East,&rsquo; by Spenser St. John.</p>
<p>Now, at last, they have been brought into the Christian fold,
though, perhaps, amongst the pine-clad mountains, heathen customs
maintain their hold upon the wild hillmen. These latter trade with
their Christian and partly-civilised brethren, bringing them jungle
produce, tobacco, and the small bezoar stones, so highly prized by the
Chinese, in return for articles they require. The Zambales raise some
rice and a little sugar. Their trade is inconsiderable, their exports
being limited to Sapan wood, jungle produce, timber, fire-wood, and
charcoal, all of which is shipped to Manila, where it finds a ready
sale. The total population of this province was 94,551 in 1876, but
only a portion of these were Zambales.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Pangasinanes (4).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Pangasinanes inhabit the north-western part of the
province of Pangasinan, and the northern part of the province of
Zambales from the River Naja, which runs into the Bay of Bazol, round
Cape Bolinao to Sual, including the Island of Cabarruyan and Santiago.
But the southern and eastern part of their province is partly inhabited
by Pampangos and Ilocanos.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are some Pangasinanes scattered about the
northern part of Nueva &Eacute;cija amongst Tagals and Ilocanos, and
there are a few as colonists in Benguet.</p>
<p>In former times the Pangasinanes occupied a wider extent of country.
When Juan Salcedo arrived he found them occupying the southern part of
La Union; but they have been and are still being pushed back by the
more hard working and energetic Ilocanos.</p>
<p>As the limits of their province do not correspond to the
ethnographical boundaries, it is not easy to estimate their numbers. I
think there may be about 300,000 of them.</p>
<p>The Pangasinanes were subjugated by the Spaniards in 1572, and in
1576 they were all Christians. Their manners and customs are similar to
those of the Pampangos and Tagals, but they have a rougher and more
uncouth appearance. Their chief occupation is cultivating rice, and
whenever this is the case the people are poor and little advanced
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>in civilisation. It is the lowest kind of
agriculture any people can follow. The first sign of prosperity in an
eastern people is given when they begin to import rice, as it shows
that they have a more remunerative occupation to follow than
cultivating it for themselves. Thus the Cagayanes who grow tobacco, the
Pampangos who grow sugar, and the Vicols of Albay and neighbouring
islands who grow hemp, all import rice.</p>
<p>Mr. J. W. Jamieson, the Acting British Consul at Sumao, in a report
on the trade of Yunnan, issued the 7th of December, 1898, says:
&ldquo;Apart from minerals, the province possesses a few other
resources and the inhabitants are lazy and unenterprising to a degree.
So long as they can grow enough rice to feed themselves and procure
enough cotton to make the few articles of clothing necessary in this
equable climate, they are content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am glad to find this confirmation of my views in this matter. Mr.
Jamieson&rsquo;s remarks apply to all the rice-growers I have seen.</p>
<p>The rice is raised in the delta of the Agno and about that river.
Formerly, the Pangasinanes not only sent rice to Manila, but exported
it to China, Siam, and Annan.</p>
<p>For this trade they built their own vessels at Lingayen, and in the
flourishing period, some twenty-five years ago, their shipwrights used
to turn out eight or ten schooners in a year, vessels able to carry 300
to 400 tons dead weight. Since the introduction of steamers into the
coasting trade, the construction of sailing vessels has greatly
diminished. Still, they turn out two or three a year.</p>
<p>In some parts of the province they make sugar, but it will not
compare in quality with that made in Pampanga. It has a smaller grain
and a paler colour, but less sweetening power. The average of thirty
samples, taken as the sugar was ladled out of the <i>tacho</i>,
was&mdash;</p>
<div class="table">

</div>
<p>It is drained in pilones, or earthenware moulds; but, unlike the
Pampanga custom, the moulds are not delivered with the sugar, but the
leaf is wrapped in the dried sheaths of the palm, tied about with split
rattan. Most of the sugar is sent by sea to Manila and exported to
China for direct <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249"
name="pb249">249</a>]</span>consumption in one of the provinces where
it finds a ready sale.</p>
<p>Indigo was formerly cultivated here and exported, and at one time a
good deal of Sapan wood was also exported, but the trade in these
articles has almost ceased.</p>
<p>Amongst the industries of Pangasinan may be mentioned the
manufacture of hats, hundreds of thousands of which were made at
Calasiao from grass or <i>nito</i>, and sent to Boston or New York.
There are also at Calasiao, and in some other towns, blacksmiths who
forge excellent <i>bolos</i> or wood-knives from the iron-bands taken
off bales of cotton cloth or sacking.</p>
<p><i>Carromatas</i>, the two-wheeled vehicles of the country, are
constructed in Lingayen and Dagupan, and are said to be very well
made.</p>
<p>I may mention here that the ponies raised in these provinces are
inferior to the Ilocanos or even the Albay breed.</p>
<p>The sands of the River Agno near Rosales, and of the streams coming
down from Mount Lagsig, are washed for gold, principally by women who
obtain but a meagre return.</p>
<p>The civilisation of the Pangasinanes is only skin-deep, and one of
their characteristics is a decided propensity to <i>remontar</i>, that
is, to abandon their towns or villages and take to the mountains, out
of reach of all authority. There are some great land-owners in
Pangasinan; one of them, Don Rafael Sison, owns an estate that
stretches from Calasiao and Santa Barbara to Urdaneta.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ilocanos (5).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This hard-working and industrious race occupies the
northern and western shores of Luzon, from Point Lacatacay on the 121st
meridian, east from Greenwich, to San Fabian, on the Gulf of Lingayen.
This includes the three provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, and La
Union. The Ilocanos have also pushed into the north-eastern part of
Pangasinan, where they occupy seven towns, and they inhabit the town of
Alcal&aacute; in the province of Cagayan, several villages in Benguet,
parts of the towns of Capas and O&rsquo;Donnell in the provinces of
Tarlac, and some towns in Zambales and Nueva &Eacute;cija. They are all
civilised and have been Christians for three centuries. Amongst them
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>dwell many converted Tinguianes and Igorrotes,
who speak the Ilocan dialect.</p>
<p>Blumentritt attributes the energy and activity of the Ilocanos to an
admixture, even though it be small, of these brave and hardy races. In
dress and appearance they are similar to the Tagals, and like them
carry the indispensable <i>bolo</i>. They cultivate tobacco, cotton,
rice, maize, indigo, sugar-cane, and a little cacao and coffee. They
also grow the pita (<i lang="la-x-bio">Agave Americana</i>), which
gives the fibre for the nipis textiles, ajonjoli (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Sesamum indicum, L.</i>), from which they extract oil, which
is used in medicine and for the hair, and they even grow some wheat.
They extract a black resin from the Antong (<i lang="la-x-bio">Canarum
Pimela</i>), which is used as incense or for making torches; another
resin from the Bangad, which is used as a varnish, another from the
Cajel (<i lang="la-x-bio">Citrus Aurantium</i>), and many others used
either in medicine, for torches, for varnishing, or for paying the
seams of wooden vessels. They get gum from the Balete (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Ficus Urostigma</i>), and from the Lucban, or orange tree
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Citrus decumana,</i> L.), oil from the Palomaria
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Calophyllum inophyllum,</i> L.), and from a large
number of other trees, some only known by the native name, and the use
of which is uncertain. They obtain dyes from many trees growing wild in
the forests, amongst others from the Tabungao (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Jatropha Curcas,</i> L.), the Lomboy (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Eugenia Lambolana,</i> Lam.), the sibucao (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Coesalpinia Sappan,</i> L.). Their cultivation of indigo is
declining, partly because the demand has diminished in consequence of
the introduction of chemical substitutes, and also because the Chinese,
into whose hands the whole produce of these provinces found its way,
adulterated it so abominably as to discredit it altogether. Yet so
great is the facility of Ilocan territory for growing indigo, that
Gregorio Sy Quia of Vigan exhibited in Madrid in 1887 no less than
seventy-five different kinds of indigo, and seventy-five different
seeds corresponding to the samples. At the same exhibition, no less
than twenty-four different kinds of rice were exhibited from Ilocos,
and this by no means exhausts the list. Every kind has a distinctive
name. The textile industry flourishes amongst these industrious people.
The Local Committee of Namagpacan, in the province of La Union, sent to
Madrid for the above-mentioned exhibition, no less than 145 different
textiles, whilst other towns sent looms and other implements. Amongst
the articles woven are quilts, cotton blankets <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>(the
celebrated Mantos de Ilocos), napkins and towels, and a great variety
of material for coats, trousers, women&rsquo;s dresses and other uses.
Guingon (called by sailors dungaree), a blue stuff for clothing, costs
from $0.50 to $0.31, 2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per vara (2 feet 9 inches),
a mixture of cotton and silk, for men&rsquo;s wear, $1.25 per vara,
silk handkerchiefs $0.25 each.</p>
<p>The Ilocans also make nets for fish, and for deer and pigs; baskets
of all sorts, salacots or hats.</p>
<p>They grow two kinds of cotton for textiles, the white and the
Coyote. Another kind, a tree cotton from the Boboy (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Eriodendron anfractuosum,</i> D.C.), is only used for
stuffing pillows. They extract oil from the seeds of all three
kinds.</p>
<p>Like the other civilized natives they live principally on rice and
fish, which they capture in large quantities. Blumentritt mentions two
kinds, the &ldquo;Ipon&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Dolon,&rdquo; which they
salt or pickle.</p>
<p>They have fine cattle, which they sell to the Igorrotes. It will be
noted that the Tinguianes, on the other hand, sell cattle to the
Ilocanos. The ponies of Ilocos are highly valued in Manila, where there
is a great demand for them. They are smaller than the ponies of other
provinces, but are very hardy and spirited, and go at a great pace.
<i lang="es">Tulisanes</i> formerly infested these provinces and found
a ready refuge in the mountains, when pursued by the <i lang=
"es">cuadrilleros</i>, or village constables, who were only armed with
<i lang="es">bolos</i>, lances, and a few old muskets. But the creation
of the Civil Guard, formed of picked officers and men, who were armed
with Remingtons and revolvers, and whose orders were, &ldquo;Do not
hesitate to shoot,&rdquo; made this business very dangerous, and the
three provinces suffer little from brigandage. When Juan Salcedo
conquered the Ilocos, he found a caste of nobles amongst them who
possessed all the riches of the country, and treated the <i lang=
"es">cailanes</i>, or serfs, with great rigour. Their tyranny caused
several bloody rebellions, and although at present matters in this
respect have improved, there is still room for complaint that the
people who do the work do not get a fair remuneration for it, the rich
man always endeavouring to keep the poor man in permanent indebtedness.
In consequence of this, the Ilocanos are ever ready to emigrate, and
besides the places I have mentioned, there are thousands of them in
Manila and other parts of the islands. They easily obtain employment
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>either as servants, cultivators, or labourers,
for they are superior in stamina to most of the civilised races, and in
industry superior to them all.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that there is a great future before this hardy,
enterprising, and industrious people.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Ibanags or Cagayanes (6).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ibanags inhabit the Babuyanes and Batanes Islands
and the northern coast of Luzon, from Point Lacaytacay to Punta
Escarpada, and all the country comprised between the Rio Grande and the
summits of the Sierra Madre as far south as Balasig.</p>
<p>They also hold the left bank of the river from the sea, right up to
the confluence of the River Magat for an average width of some five
miles.</p>
<p>They are said to be the finest race and the most valiant men in the
islands, and to have manfully resisted the Spaniards.</p>
<p>However, they were conquered and converted to Christianity. From the
year 1781 they have been subjected to the worst form of slavery, the
forced cultivation of tobacco. The detestable abuses brought into this
system by the unblushing rascality of the agents of the treasury,
became, finally, so glaring, and the condition of the Ibanags so
dreadful, that, in 1882, the Governor-General, Moriones (see Chapter
&ldquo;Spanish Government&rdquo;), forced the hand of C&aacute;novas
and the royal family, who desired to sell the monopoly, and this
horrible slavery ceased, having lasted over a century, going from bad
to worse.</p>
<p>Since that date the condition of the Ibanags has greatly improved;
they have continued the cultivation of tobacco, and private enterprise
has done much to introduce the finest seed and to improve the
cultivation and preparatory operations. The &ldquo;<span lang=
"es">Compa&ntilde;ia Tabacalera de Filipinas</span>,&rdquo; a
Franco-Catalan enterprise, has established the Haciendas of San
Antonio, San Rafael, and Santa Isabel, in the district of Isabela.</p>
<p>They have built large warehouses in Tuma&uacute;ini and have agents
in all the principal towns.</p>
<p>On the river they have a stern-wheel steamer, the <i>Antonio
Lopez</i>, and a number of steel-lighters for carrying down
tobacco.</p>
<p>The tobacco is ready for transport in December and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>January. It is sent down the river to Aparri,
from whence it is shipped to Manila. In a normal dry season (February
to August), the river is navigable for steamers of two feet draught up
to Alcal&aacute;, the trade of which town is not important; but that of
Tugueg&aacute;rao is so, and up to that point the current is not
strong.</p>
<p>Amongst the Ibanags the distinction of noble and plebeian has been
as strongly marked as amongst the Tagals, Pampangos, and Ilocanos, and
the intense cupidity of the nobles, or rather usurers, which name
better describes them, has led to many bloody outbreaks on the part of
the oppressed and enslaved debtors.</p>
<p>The government has steadily encouraged the Ilocanos and others to
settle in Cagayan and plant tobacco, giving them free passages and
advances of money in the days of the monopoly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the discontent of the Ibanags has led them to
migrate to other provinces when possible, for the authorities prevented
them from doing so by force when they could. They especially
endeavoured to get to Manila, and I remember many years ago the arrival
of a starving and ragged band, who had tramped all the way from Isabela
to Manila to escape from their cruel task-masters.</p>
<p>However, things are better with them now, and I hope means will be
found under the Stars and Stripes to introduce a better system of
finance, and to curb the greed of the usurer, either by legislation or
by competition on a fair and humane basis. The Ibanag language is
spreading greatly amongst the hill-tribes around them as a commercial
language, just as Ilocano is spreading on the West Coast.</p>
<p>Under American influence an immense development of the provinces of
Cagayan and Isabela may be expected in the near future, and the Ibanags
will doubtless benefit by this. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is an important, and to me, the most interesting
of the independent or partly subdued races of the Philippines. They are
a fine, hardy, industrious, and warlike race, well worth a great and
patient effort to bring them within the pale of Christianity, and to
advance the civilisation they have already attained. They are of a dark
bronze colour, with straight black and abundant hair, large dark eyes
set rather obliquely as amongst Chinese. Their faces are broad with
high cheek-bones, the nose aquiline and the head large. The features in
general have a Mongolian cast, and a certain nasal twang in their
speech resembles that of the Southern Chinese. The men have capacious
chests, showing good lung-power, their muscles well developed
indicating great strength and ability to resist fatigue. The women have
also well-marked figures and rounded limbs. The fashions vary with
different tribes, but it is common to find both sexes wearing their
hair cut in a fringe over the forehead, but reaching down to the
eyebrows, long enough at the sides to cover the ears, left long at the
back of the head, where it is gathered up into a knot.</p>

<p>The Igorrotes of Lepanto wear beards, some of them are as thick as a
Spaniard&rsquo;s, but the tribes farther South pull out, not only their
beards, but all the hair on their bodies, except that of the head.
Their dress varies from a mere apron (Bahaque) when at work in the
fields, to an ornamental jacket very smartly cut and elaborate
sword-belt when at war or on any full-dress occasion. These jackets are
very handsome and have stripes of blue, crimson and white. They wear a
variety of head-dresses, turban, Salacot or a kind of cocked-hat and
feathers. Both men and women wear cloaks or plaids of bright colours
made of cotton. Although the word Igorrote has come to be <span class=

"pb255">255</a>]</span>almost a generic name for the heathen
Highlanders of North Luzon, it is here limited to those who dwell on
the Western part of the Cordillera Central, comprising the whole of the
districts of Benguet and Lepanto, part of Bontoc and parts of the
Provinces of La Union and Ilocos Sur. The sub-tribes Buriks and Busaos
are included.</p>
<p>Tattooing is very general amongst them. In some districts you can
hardly find a man or woman who has not a figure of the sun tattooed in
blue on the back of the hand, for in Central Benguet they worship the
sun. Some <span class="corr" id="xd20e8557" title="Source: o">of</span>
them tattoo the breast and arms in patterns of straight and curved
lines pricked in with a needle in indigo blue. The Busao Igorrotes, who
live in the North of Lepanto, tattoo flowers on their arms, and in
war-dress wear a <span class="corr" id="xd20e8560" title=
"Source: cylindical">cylindrical</span> shako made of wood or plaited
rattan, and large copper pendants in their ears. These people do not
use the Talibon, and prefer the spear. The Burik Igorrotes tattoo the
body in a curious manner, giving them the appearance of wearing a coat
of mail. But this custom is probably now becoming obsolete, for at
least those of the Igorrotes who live near the Christian natives are
gradually adopting their dress and customs.</p>
<p>White is the colour of mourning, as amongst the Moros of Mindanao
and Sulu. Both sexes are fond of personal ornaments, such as ear-rings,
collars, arm-rings, bangles, leg-rings and belts. Collars of
crocodiles&rsquo; teeth are highly esteemed. In the long list of their
manufactures I shall enumerate their ornaments. Their arms are the
<i>talibon</i>, a short double-edged sword; the <i>gayang</i>, a
javelin or assegai; and the <i>aligua</i>, a light axe, having a spike
at the back opposite to the cutting edge. After throwing their
javelins, they rush on with their drawn swords, holding their shield,
called a <i>calata</i>, on the left arm. This is made of light wood and
is long and narrow. With the exception of the shape of the shield their
equipment is much like that of the Roman Legionaries twenty centuries
since. The <i>aligua</i> appears to be used, not as a fighting weapon,
but to decapitate their fallen enemies and as a means of carrying the
head home on a spike. Great rejoicings, with feasts and dances, were
held after a successful skirmish, and large quantities of liquor
consumed. But the constant pressure of the Spanish authority has in a
great measure stopped these petty wars. They make a kind of beer called
<i>Basi</i> by fermenting cane-juice, and another liquor, something
like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>the chicha of the Peruvian Coast Indians, from
rice. This latter is called <i>bundang</i>. They are great smokers, and
make their own pipes of various materials. They appear not to have
universally adopted the Malay custom of chewing buyo. There is a
settlement of Christian Igorrotes on the coast of Ilocos Sur, close to
the boundary of La Union, which has been established many years. But in
general the Igorrotes have steadily refused to embrace Christianity,
and evidently do not want to go to the same heaven as the Spaniards.
The behaviour of the troops led against them in 1881 by General Primo
de Rivera doubtless confirmed them in this repugnance. The expedition
did not do much in the way of fighting, Remingtons and mountain-guns
failed to subdue the bold mountaineers armed only with javelin and
sword. The Spanish officers and men, however, are reported to have
abominably mishandled the Igorrote women. For this ravishing foray the
late King Alfonso XII. bestowed the title of Vizconde de la Union upon
Primo de Rivera, and showered promotions and crosses upon his
staff.</p>
<p>The Igorrotes live in villages with a population of three or four
hundred souls. There is a chief to each, but the villages are not
organised into states, each being independent. The chief is supposed to
be chosen from the families called <i>Mainguel</i>, who have
distinguished themselves in war. As a matter of fact, the richest man
usually becomes chief. The wealthy families vie with each other in the
grand feasts which they give to all comers. The noble and the
illustrious guests are personally invited to these feasts, but the
common people assemble at beat of drum. The chief presides at the
meeting of the <i>Bacuanes</i> or nobles in whom are vested the village
lands, and who direct its affairs.</p>
<p>The common people are in a kind of bondage to the nobles, and
cultivate their lands for them. In Lepanto they are called
<i>cailianes</i> as in Ilocos. Their houses are square, and similar to
those of the other natives in the outlying districts, being raised on
posts above the ground-level. A framework of bamboos is supported on
four trunks of trees, the roof is thatched with <i>cogon</i> (elephant
grass) and the sides are closed in by canes, bamboos or pine planks.
Each house stands in an enclosure of its own, strongly fenced with
rough stones or posts. They are far inferior to the Christian natives
in the arrangement <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257"
name="pb257">257</a>]</span>of their houses. Instead of having a
separate kitchen on a <i>pantalan</i> or raised platform, the fire is
made in the centre of the house, and the smoke finds its way out
through a hole in the roof. The rafters and inside of the thatch is
blackened by the soot. They make no windows to their houses and only a
small door, the ladder to which is drawn up when they retire to rest.
They are not clean in their persons, and neglect to wash their clothes,
or clean the interiors of their houses. They thus compare very
unfavourably with the Tagals as regards cleanliness, although, as we
shall see, in some other respects they are greatly above them. Each
village has its Town Hall, which they call the <i>Balta-oa</i>. This is
where the Town Council assembles to settle the affairs of the
community, to hear requests for divorces, and to administer the law to
offenders. Public festivities also take place here.</p>
<p>They are monogamous, and have the highest respect for the holiness
of the marriage tie. It is not absolutely indissoluble, but can be
dissolved by the village council on serious grounds; but apparently
divorce is systematically discouraged, and the sacredness of marriage
is upheld. In former times adulteresses were punished by beheading, but
more lenient views now prevail, and a good whipping is considered
sufficient to meet the case. Generally death only dissolves the tie,
and even then only partially, as re-marriage is difficult; for it is
not proper for the widow to marry again without the consent of her late
husband&rsquo;s family, which may not easily be obtained, and if she
contracts new ties, the children of her first marriage are removed from
her control. On the other hand, Igorrote respectability requires that a
widower should entirely neglect his toilet and commune silently with
his grief for several years before taking to himself a new wife. Like
most heathen, they show the greatest respect and affection for their
parents, and cherish them to their life&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast with the license accorded to young girls by the
Tagals and Visayas, the Igorrotes carefully guard the chastity of their
daughters, and do not allow them to go about without a chaperon. The
father even often accompanies them on their excursions. When they
arrive at the age of puberty, the boys and girls are separated.</p>
<p>In each village there are two special buildings not too near each
other. In one of these the girls sleep under the watchful guard of a
duenna, who looks after their morals, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>and in the other the
youths under the care of an elder. The youth caught violating the
sanctity of the damsels&rsquo; dormitory, or the maiden who is detected
in an intrigue, or shows signs of maternity, may expect a severe
correction. They do not seem to raise as many difficulties about the
marriage of their daughters as the Tagals do, and they do not make it a
matter of a mercenary bargain. When a youth takes a fancy to a
marriageable maiden of his own degree, he applies through his parents
to the father of the girl, and if he and his daughter look with favour
on the proposal, the young man is admitted to cohabit with the damsel.
But if within a certain period the girl does not show signs of
succession, the would-be bridegroom is sent about his business. On the
other hand, if pregnancy is announced, the wedding takes place with all
possible ceremony, including an invocation of the <i>Anitos</i> or
ancestral gods, feasts and dances, which last eight or nine days, but
the young couple are excused from attendance. The Igorrotes, in fact,
openly recognise a custom which is practised to a great extent in the
agricultural districts of England and Scotland, with this difference,
that the Christian youth in the latter countries often evades the
marriage, while the heathen Igorrote carries out his engagement. I
think, on the whole, the heathen comes out best.</p>
<p>Although so desirous of offspring, they like to have them come one
at a time, and they consider it to be an evil omen when one of their
women brings forth twins. In such a case the last born is handed over
to whoever desires to adopt it. This is held to avert the omen and
straighten things out again.</p>
<p>Of late years the establishment of forts with the Tagal or Visayas
garrisons in the Igorrote territory, and closer contact with Christians
generally, have tended to demoralise the heathen, and, above all, to
lower somewhat their lofty ideal of chastity.</p>

<p>Amongst the Igorrotes of Lepanto, and those farthest removed from
Spanish influence, when a man of position dies, a notification is sent
to all his blood-relations, even though they reside at a great
distance, and the corpse is not buried until they have all arrived and
have each taken the dead man&rsquo;s hand in theirs, inquiring of him
tenderly why he has abandoned his family. All this time a great feast
is going on outside the house, vast quantities of rice and meat are
provided and consumed, and an unlimited <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>allowance of beer
drunk by the guests. The expense is often out of all proportion to the
means of the family and perhaps involves them in debt for years.</p>
<p>In the Igorrote territory under Spanish influence this extravagance
and delay of burial is discouraged. Some of the Igorrotes dry their
dead over a fire in a similar way to the Tinguianes. The dead are
buried in a sitting posture, after the manner of the Peruvian Indians,
but enclosed in coffins, which are placed in any small cave or cleft in
the rocks, enlarged by hand if necessary. The Igorrotes believe in a
Supreme Being, the creator and preserver; he is called <i>Apo</i> in
Benguet, and <i>Lu-ma-oig</i> in Lepanto. The wife of <i>Apo</i> is
called <i>Bangan</i>, the daughter <i>Bugan</i> and the son
<i>Ubban</i>. There are two inferior gods, <i>Cabigat</i> and
<i>Suyan</i>, these deities hold intercourse with mankind through the
<i>Anitos</i> or ancestral spirits, some good, some evil, who reward or
chastise mankind in this life. They represent these spirits by
roughly-carved idols of wood. Some of these idols are male and others
female. Occasionally the carving is of an obscene nature, and similar
to some clay images I have seen taken from tombs in Peru. They practise
family prayer, and the object of it is to solicit the favour of the
Anitos. Sometimes the will of the Anitos is declared through an old
priestess called an <i>Asitera</i>, who receives a fee for her pains.
The ancestral spirits are more worshipped than the gods. Poultry,
swine, and dogs, may not be slaughtered except in a sacrificial manner.
There is a priest in every village called the <i>Manbunung</i> who
first consecrates the animal to the Anitos, and then kills it and
returns it to the owner, reserving, however, the best piece for
himself. In company with his first-born son he takes the lead at
prayer-meetings, or on special occasions, such as illness, marriage,
the commencing some important work, or averting some evil omen. This
man makes some pretence at healing the sick, but rather with charms and
incantations than by administering medicine. There is a sacred tree
near each village, which is regarded as the seat of the Anitos. In the
shade of this is a sacrificial stone. Sometimes near a house may been
seen a small bench for the Anitos to repose on, and a dish of rice or
other food for their refreshment. The Igorrotes believe that there are
two places where the souls of the dead travel to. One is an agreeable
residence provided with everything necessary to happiness, and is for
the spirits of those who have died <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260"
href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>a natural death. But if they
have been evil-doers, such as robbers or murderers, and have escaped
due punishment on earth, they are punished here by the other souls
before being allowed to enjoy the advantages of the place. But the
souls of brave warriors killed in battle, and of women who have died in
child-birth, arrive at a much more desirable place, a real heaven, and
reside amongst the gods.</p>

<p>The Igorrotes of Cabugalan in Lepanto regard eels as the embodiment
of their ancestors; they will not catch them or do them any harm, but
feed them when opportunity offers. The <i>Asiteras</i> assist at feasts
and make invocations and propose toasts which are drunk by the men
present. The private or family feasts are called <i>Bumaguil</i>, being
held in the giver&rsquo;s house or courtyard, but public entertainments
or feasts of the whole village are called <i>Regnas</i>, and are held
in or in front of the <i>Balta-oa</i> or Town Hall. They are preceded
and followed by songs and dances. The songs are inharmonious and
monotonous. The dances vary with the localities. In one dance bowing to
the beer-mugs is a feature. As amongst other Malay races, ordeals are
in fashion to decide disputes. One consists in a priest or chief
scratching the scalps of the disputants with a small iron fork. Whoever
loses most blood during this operation has lost his case. The
<span class="corr" id="xd20e8718" title=
"Source: Igorrottes">Igorrotes</span> work hard at their agriculture,
and their rice-farming is excellent. They plough the valleys with the
aid of buffaloes and terrace the hillsides, which they cultivate by
hand. They burn down the pine-forests to clear the hills. They irrigate
where possible, carrying the canals over any ravine by means of rude
aqueducts. They grow considerable quantities of tobacco,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e8722src" href="#xd20e8722" name="xd20e8722src">1</a>
which is, however, of inferior quality. This they sell to the civilised
natives, and it is exported. I suppose it goes to Hamburg to make
German Havana cigars, just as conger eels go to Paris to make fillets
of soles. They cultivate sweet potatoes, also the ordinary potatoes,
which grow well, and although small, are much prized in Manila, and
meet with a ready sale. The <span class="corr" id="xd20e8725" title=
"Source: Igorrottes">Igorrotes</span> of Lepanto eagerly seek new seeds
to plant. It is strange that an agricultural people like this should
have little or no idea of breeding cattle, but instead of doing so,
they purchase from the Ilocanos and others cattle, horses, and pigs for
consumption, paying good prices for them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>They even buy dogs to
eat. I have been assured by Mr. Ernest Heald, formerly British
Vice-Consul at Sual, that he has often seen Igorrotes returning to the
hills from Dagupan, leading strings of dogs, which they had purchased
for food at prices varying from twenty-five to fifty cents, and that
the dogs seemed to have an instinctive idea what they were being taken
away for. The cooking of the Igorrotes is abominable, especially their
way of cooking meat. It would not obtain the approval of Brillat
Savarin. They seem to have no objection to eating it putrid, and their
robust constitutions apparently prevent their suffering from ptomaine
poisoning. The most remarkable characteristic of the Igorrotes is their
skill as smiths, miners, and metallurgists. Their forges are not
usually in their villages, but are hidden away in the forest; they use
piston-blowers instead of bellows, and charcoal as fuel. Their
lance-heads, swords, and other weapons are well shaped and of excellent
quality. They worked the copper ores of Mancayen in Lepanto very
successfully. From official documents it appears that from 1840 to 1855
they sold on an average each year about nineteen tons of copper, either
in ingots or manufactured. Then a Spanish Company took up the work and
ignominiously failed. Gold mining and washing was formerly a monopoly
of the nobles, and the washing is so still to some extent. For
centuries, and long before the Spanish conquest, the Igorrotes have
brought down gold to trade with the coast natives. Such particulars as
are known to me about Igorrote mining, smelting, and gold-washing, will
be found under the headings Gold, Copper, Iron, in <a href=
"#ch16">Chapter XVI</a>.</p>
<p>I have added to this account of them a list of such of their
manufactures as I have seen or could learn of, and in most instances I
have given the Igorrote name. The Igorrotes have several dialects, so
that the names of the various articles may vary according to the
locality. Herewith a list of the dialects and the places where each is
spoken, taken from Spanish official sources.</p>

<p>Many of the Principales or head-men and others under Spanish
influence speak and write Ilocano, which they find necessary for their
trade with that people. More than twenty years ago there were seven
schools in Lepanto regularly attended by five hundred and sixty-two
children, of whom one hundred and ten could then read and write
Spanish. No doubt by this time these schools have considerably
increased.</p>
<p>I am much impressed by the great industry of these people and with
the great skill they show in everything they undertake. It is therefore
disappointing to read in Foreman&rsquo;s book &lsquo;The Philippine
Islands,&rsquo; p. 213: &ldquo;Like all the races of the Philippines,
they are indolent to the greatest degree.&rdquo; Foreman goes on to
say, Polygamy seems to be permitted, murders are common, their huts are
built bee-hive fashion, they keep a Dr. and Cr. account of heads with
the Negritos. All this is probably in consequence of accepting idle
stories as facts, and is nothing less than a libel on the Igorrotes. A
people who believe in a Supreme Being, Creator of heaven and earth, in
the immortality of the soul, in an upper and lower heaven, in
punishment after death, if it has been evaded in life, who are strict
monogamists, and who have a high belief in the sacredness of the
marriage tie; a people who guard the chastity of their daughters as
carefully as the British or the Americans; a people physically strong,
brave, skilful, and industrious, have nothing in common with the
wretches Foreman described under their name. These people live in the
fairest and healthiest parts of Luzon, no fevers lurk amongst those
pine-clad mountains, no sultry heats sap the vital powers. What an
opportunity for a grand missionary enterprise! What a noble material to
work on, every condition seems favourable. The very fact of their
rejection of the form of Christianity presented to them, and their
distrust of the Spaniards, may influence them in favour of some simpler
doctrine. I shall feel well repaid for my labour in describing these
people, if the truthful picture I have attempted to present of them
should interest those who have the means and the will to inaugurate a
new era, to help them along the Path. A perusal of what the old
chroniclers say about them convinces me that they have done much
themselves to improve their moral condition, and that many detestable
customs, at all events attributed to them, have long since been
relegated to oblivion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href=

<p class="first">These people live in the south-west corner of Nueva
Vizcaya, about the head-waters of the River Magat. They are numerous,
and occupy many towns and villages, amongst them Bayombong, Dupax,
Bambang, and Aritas. They were formerly warlike head-hunters, and are
said to have devoured the hearts and brains of their slain enemies in
order to inherit their courage and wisdom. This is a Chinese idea, and
is even now practised in Canton, where pieces of the heart and liver of
a particularly hardened and desperate criminal are retailed by the
executioner at a high price for the above purpose. They wear their hair
long like the Ilongotes. Their weapons were the lance, shield, or
wood-knife, and in their customs and religion they resembled the
Igorrotes. They were said to ornament the hilts of their swords with
the teeth of their slain enemies. All these detestable customs have now
disappeared; they have been converted to Christianity, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>now
are peaceful agriculturists and hunters. Game and fish abound; a
telegraph line runs through their territory with a station at
Bayombong. This is part of the line from Manila to Aparri.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ibilaos (14).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These savages inhabit the hilly country about the
sources of the River Casepuan, which, according to
D&rsquo;Almonte&rsquo;s map, is a tributary of the River Casiguran,
which runs into the Bay of Baler; but, according to Olleros, is a
tributary of the Rio Grande de Cagayan. However this may be, their
habitat is on the borders of Nueva &Eacute;cija and Nueva Vizcaya. Some
of these people have been subjugated, but the others live a nomadic
life in the mountain forests, and resemble the Negritos. Their pleasure
is to lie in wait and shoot the passers-by with their arrows. Like the
Italones they are said to ornament their weapons with the teeth of the
slain, and, like them, wear their hair long. The independent Ibilaos
live by the chase, and on jungle produce, and do no cultivation. They
are small of stature and weak. It is possible that they are a hybrid
Negrito Malay race. Their bloodthirsty propensities make them a curse
to their neighbours.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Ilongotes (15).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ilongotes inhabit the rocky fastnesses of the
range of mountains on the east coast, called the Caraballo de Baler,
the whole length of the Distrito del Principe, the north-east corner of
Nueva Vizcaya and a strip of the southern part of Isabela.</p>
<p>Their neighbours on the east are the Negritos, who live along the
sea-shore. These people are also their neighbours on the north, where
they inhabit the mountains.</p>
<p>On the west they have the Ifugaos in the northerly part of their
boundary, and civilised Indians of mixed races in the southern part.
Their nearest neighbours to the south are some scattered Tagals.</p>
<p>Blumentritt describes them from a photograph lent him by Dr. A. B.
Meyer, as having eyes long and deeply sunk, upper lip and chin hairy,
the hair long plaited in a tail, and often reaching the hips. A Spanish
authority describes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270"
name="pb270">270</a>]</span>them as similar to the other hillmen, but
wearing long hair, and dirty and disagreeable in their aspect</p>
<p>Their dress is as primitive as that of the other savage races, the
adult men wearing a band of beaten bark round the waist, the women
wearing a tapis, and the children going quite naked. They wear rings or
spirals of brass wire on their arms, necklaces, and other ornaments.
But when the men have occasion to go into the Christian villages, they
wear shirts and trousers. I have myself seen instances of this custom
amongst the Tagban&uacute;as in Palawan.</p>
<p>They are clever smiths and know how to temper their weapons. Their
lances have different shaped heads, and the shafts are made of Palma
Brava. Their swords are well-made and ornamented, and are carried in a
wooden scabbard from a belt of webbing. This appears to be their
favourite weapon. They never go unarmed, even for a few paces, and they
sleep with their weapons beside them. Their shields are of light wood,
carved, and painted red.</p>
<p>Their domestic life is not unlike that of the Christian natives, for
they are not polygamists; they, however, are more careless and dirty.
They purchase their wife from her parents. They subsist by hunting and
fishing, and by cultivating rice, maize, sweet potatoes, and other
vegetables. They grow tobacco, which they exchange for other goods with
the Christian natives. They catch the wild <i>carabaos</i> in traps.
They are ineradicably addicted to head-hunting, and wage a continual
war with all their neighbours, but if an interval of peace occurs, they
fight one family or clan against another, for they must have heads. The
marriage ceremony cannot be completed till the bridegroom has presented
the bride with some of these grisly trophies; heads of Christians for
choice.</p>
<p>They signify war by placing arrows in the path and sprinkling blood
upon it. Treaties of peace, or rather truces, are sometimes ratified by
human sacrifices, and the ceremony of blood-brothership is
practised.</p>
<p>They have few religious practices, although they believe in a
Supreme Being, and in the ancestor-worship common to the country. The
relatives assemble to celebrate a birth by a feast. On the fifth day a
name is given to the infant. They take care of the sick and endeavour
to cure them with herbs, to which they ascribe medicinal virtues. If
the patient dies, the relatives devour everything in the house in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>order to mitigate their grief, and they bury the
corpse within twenty-four hours of death, placing some provisions upon
the grave. From a statement in a Spanish official publication, the
Ilongote dialect is spoken in two towns and twenty-two rancherias of
Nueva Vizcaya, and in four rancherias in the district of Principe. This
shows that at least on their western border they are now somewhat held
in check. But the poor Negritos still have to suffer their
incursions.</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Mayoyaos and Silipanes (16).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These people are very numerous, and inhabit the
north-west corner of Nueva Vizcaya, and the south-west corner of
Isabela, between the Cordillera Central and the River Magat. For
neighbours, they have on the east the Ifugaos, those deadly
lasso-throwers; on the west, the Igorrotes are separated from them by
the Cordillera; to the north they have the Gaddanes, and the
Itetapanes, and to the south the Italones. In appearance, dress, arms
and ornaments, they resemble the Igorrotes of Lepanto. The Ifugao
language is spoken at the missions of Quiangan and Silipan, and in a
large number of hamlets of these people. They were pacified and
converted to Christianity about half a century ago, and are gradually
improving in civilisation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Ifugaos (17).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ifugaos, who bear a strong resemblance to the
Japanese, inhabit a territory in central Nueva Vizcaya, and in the
south of Isabela, mostly between the River Magat and the Rio Grande,
but they have a great many hamlets on the left bank of the Magat. They
cultivate rice, camote, and other crops, but prefer to live by robbery
whenever possible. They are persistent head-hunters, frequently at war
with the neighbouring tribes, or amongst themselves.</p>
<p>One notable peculiarity must be mentioned. Besides the lance, knife,
and bow and arrows, they use the lasso, which they throw with great
dexterity. Lurking near a trail, they cast the fatal coil over some
unwary traveller, and promptly decapitate him, to add his skull to
their collection, and decorate their hut.</p>
<p>It is their custom to wear as many rings in their ears as they have
taken heads. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>Major Galvez, after a skirmish with these people, found the corpse
of one of their warriors who wore thirty-two death-rings in his
ears.</p>
<p>Their religion is said to be after the style of the Igorrotes, and
some other hill-tribes of Luzon. Their chief god Cabunian had two sons,
Sumabit and Cabigat, and two daughters, Buingan and Daunguen, who
married amongst themselves, and from them the human race is descended.
Ancestor-worship is also practised. The Spaniards built and garrisoned
a chain of forts in the Ifugao territory to keep them in order, and of
late years their murderous incursions have been kept in check. It would
require an enquiry on the spot to say whether there is any prospect of
this tribe becoming civilised, and converted to Christianity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Gaddanes (18).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Gaddanes occupy the north-east quarter of Saltan
and Bondoc, and their territory stretches over into Isabela in a
south-easterly direction to the River Magat, thus bordering on the
five-mile strip of Ibanag territory on the left bank of the Rio Grande.
The upper part of the Rio Chico runs through their Saltan territory,
and the River Libug through their Isabela territory.</p>
<p>In appearance they are darker than any other of the hillmen of
Luzon. They are not as well built as the Igorrotes. They have round
eyes, and large, flat noses. They are very dirty. Their houses are
built on lofty piles, and the ladder is drawn up at night, or in war
time. They are partly converted to Christianity, and are of a milder
disposition than their neighbours.</p>

<p class="first">These people live in Bontoc, almost the centre of
Northern Luzon. On the west they have the Busaos Igorrotes, on the east
the Gaddanes, to the north-west they have the Guinanes, and to the
south the Mayoyaos. They are more like the Gaddanes than any other
neighbours, especially in the eyes and hair, yet in other respects they
are something like the Negritos in appearance, and much more so in
their dispositions and customs, for it has not been possible to
civilise them. Their arms are the same as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>the Busaos, and, like
them, they wear a cylindrical shako, which they dye a brilliant red.
They appear to be a hopeless race.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These terrible neighbours of the peaceful Tinguianes
inhabit both slopes of the Cordillera Central in Abra and Bontoc. They
do not pass to the west of the River Abra, or its affluent, the
Pusulguan.</p>
<p>On the south the Guinanes have the warlike Busaos, who are well able
to defend themselves, and to retaliate on their aggressors.
Consequently, the Tinguianes are the principal victims; in fact, some
years back, they had no peace, and are not now free from danger.</p>
<p>The fame and respect enjoyed by a successful head-hunter is the
great incentive to them to persevere in their sanguinary forays, which
they conduct with the greatest cunning.</p>
<p>The return of the head-hunters to their village with their ghastly
trophies is celebrated by prolonged and frantic orgies&mdash;feasting
and drinking, singing war-songs, music and dancing. In fact, their
rejoicings only differ in degree and intensity from those customary in
Christian nations to celebrate the slaughter of their enemies.</p>
<p>So fond are the Guinanes of getting heads, that when not at war with
other tribes they fight amongst themselves.</p>
<p>They are much like the Igorrotes, and, like them, are settled in
towns and villages. They practise agriculture, and are excellent
smiths, and forge specially good knives, which are much esteemed by the
Busaos, and find a ready sale amongst them.</p>
<p>Little is known of their manners and customs, or of their numbers,
since few travellers care to run the risk of having their skulls added
to the collection of some connoisseur.</p>
<p>I cannot suggest any use this tribe could be to the United States,
for I do not think the most enthusiastic or devoted missionary would
hanker after being appointed to convert them, and even if such an one
could be found, the probability of his success would be very small.

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Tinguianes (27).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Tinguianes inhabit the western half of the
province of Abra, and their villages are thickly scattered about on the
eastern slopes of the Ilocos mountains, and on the banks of the River
Abra. They have also pushed their way to the extreme north-east corner
of Abra, and they extend southwards and westwards along the coast as
far as Punta Darigayos. Santiago is a Christian Tinguian town, and was
founded in 1736.</p>
<p>The Tinguianes are of a peaceful disposition, and are gradually
becoming civilised and converted to Christianity. In fact, of late
years, the advance of the Spaniards has been considerable. It is only
in the more remote parts of their territory that some of them retain
their independence, and their ancient laws, beliefs and customs. The
constant intercourse they have with the Ilocanos has resulted in
spreading that dialect amongst them, whilst their own language is dying
out.</p>
<p>In appearance the Tinguianes differ considerably from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>the
other mountain tribes of Luzon, being taller, and of a much lighter
colour. Their noses are not flattened like those of the Malays, but are
aquiline, and remind one of the features of the Cholos of the Peruvian
coast. They are a cleanly people; the men wear turbans, jacket and
trousers; the women belonging to their nobility have their garments
beautifully embroidered. They wear arm-sheaths, and sometimes
leg-sheaths, made of plaited fibre, and ornamented with beads, or with
coloured stones, brought from the Batanes islands, which they purchase
in Ilocos. They also wear necklaces of these stones, copper or silver
ear-rings, and other trinkets.</p>
<p>Spanish writers consider these people to have a strong admixture of
Chinese blood, and suppose it may be from a remnant of the pirates
under Li-ma-hon, who were defeated by Juan Salcedo in 1574. The learned
Blumentritt, however, dissents from this opinion, which he considers to
be a modern invention, and gives Salcedo credit for doing his work very
thoroughly, and not letting many of the pirates escape. He says that,
although in dress and appearance the Tinguianes are very similar to the
fishermen of the province of Fo-Kien, there are no Chinese words to be
found in their dialect, and that consequently the intermixture of
Chinese can only have been small. However this may be, the coast of
Fo-Kien, which is opposite Formosa, is only about 500 miles from the
Port of Vigan, the currents are favourable for the southerly voyage,
and sailing craft can cross in either monsoon. Consequently, either as
traders, fugitives, or castaways, Fo-Kien sailors or fishermen could
easily have arrived on the coast.</p>
<p>The Tinguianes assiduously cultivate their land, and irrigate their
rice-fields with some skill. They breed horses and cattle, which they
sell in the markets of Ilocos, as well as jungle produce, wax, skins
and gold-dust. They raft timber down the Abra River and make for sale
various articles of wood, such as <i>bateas</i>, ladles and spoons,
also they make mats and baskets.</p>

<p class="first xd20e1984">[<i>To face p. 276.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Their marriages are conducted in a similar manner to those of other
tribes, the ceremony, whether Christian or heathen, being followed by
the usual feasts and dancing, and music in the intervals of eating and
drinking. Their instruments are drums, flutes and guitars. As usual,
roast pig is the principal dish, the animal being roasted whole on a
spit of cane. When the feast is over the newly-married <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>couple are conducted to their house by the
principal chief or elder. A large mat being spread on the <span class=
"corr" id="xd20e9882" title="Source: gound">ground</span> they lie down
on it keeping at a distance of several feet from each other. A boy of
six or eight years of age then lies down between them, and the elders
retire leaving the trio together. The bride and bridegroom are
forbidden to indulge in any caresses, nor even to speak to each other
till the following day. The healthy life led by the women enables them
to recover very rapidly after child-birth. In fact, they return to
their usual avocations directly after the ceremony of purification,
which consists of washing the newly-born infant in running water.
Divorce among the heathen is merely a matter of paying a fine of some
thirty dollars, in money or in kind, to the village chief or elder, or
to the Goberna-doreillo, if the village is under Spanish rule. Divorce
is not allowed amongst those who are converted, and this must be a
great hindrance to their acceptance of Christianity.</p>
<p>They take little care of the sick, and when hope is given up the
patient is left alone to die. The Peruvian Indians have a similar
custom. Amongst the Serranos, when a sick person does not soon show
signs of recovery, a family meeting is called, and a fixed sum is voted
for his cure, say twelve or twenty reals. When this amount has been
spent, the patient is removed from his couch and laid upon a hide on
the ground outside the house. A child is posted to fan him and keep off
the flies, and only water is given him till he dies.</p>
<p>The Tinguianes formerly buried their dead in pits dug under their
houses, after subjecting the corpses to a baking or drying process, and
on certain days in the year food was placed near the tombs for the
souls of the dead to partake of. Those who are converted have of course
to bury their dead in the cemetery, and to pay a fee to the priest.</p>
<p>They share the idea that seems to prevail amongst all Malays, that
the soul is absent from the body during sleep, and that consequently it
is dangerous and wicked to awake anybody suddenly. The most dreadful
thing that can happen to anybody, therefore, is to die whilst sleeping,
leaving his soul wandering about. Their most desperate curse is to wish
that this may happen to an adversary. This seems to reach a higher
level of cursing than the oaths of the Tagals which I have previously
mentioned. The usual respect for ancestors is shown, and any weapons or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>ornaments which have belonged to them are
carefully preserved as valued heirlooms. The names of an ancestor must,
however, on no account be pronounced by his descendants, so that if any
necessity arises to answer a question which involves mentioning the
name of one, a friend not related to the person enquired about must be
called in to answer.</p>
<p>Monsieur de la Gironi&egrave;re visited these people, and describes
them as men of good stature, slightly bronzed, with straight hair,
regular profiles, and aquiline noses. The women truly beautiful and
graceful. They appeared to him to resemble the people of the South of
France, except for their costume and language. The men wore a belt and
a sort of turban made from the bark of the fig-tree. Their arms
consisted of a long lance, a small axe, called <i>aligua</i>, and a
shield. The women wore a belt and a narrow apron which came down to
their knees, their heads being ornamented with pearls, and grains of
coral and gold were fixed amongst their hair. The upper parts of their
hands were painted blue, and they wore plaited sheaths ornamented with
beads on their fore-arms; these sheaths strongly compressed the
fore-arm, being put on when the women were young, and they prevented
the development of the fore-arm, whilst causing the wrists and hands to
swell. This is a beauty amongst the Tinguianes as the little foot is
amongst the Chinese.</p>
<p>They occupied seventeen villages, and each family had two
habitations, one on the ground for use in the day, and one fixed on
piles or on the summits of lofty trees, as much as sixty or eighty feet
from the ground, where they sleep, to protect themselves from the
nocturnal attacks of the Guinanes, their mortal and sanguinary enemies.
From these lofty dwellings they threw down stones upon assailants. In
the middle of each village there is a large shed which serves for
meetings and public ceremonies. He further states that after an attack
of the Guinanes had been repulsed from Laganguilan-y-Madalay by the
Tinguianes he went to an assembly at that village and witnessed a
ceremony in honour of the victory. The heads of the slain enemies were
exhibited to the crowd, and various speeches were made. The skulls were
then split open and the brains removed and given to some young girls,
who worked them up with their hands in a quantity of <i>basi</i> or
native beer. The compound was then served in cups to the chiefs, who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>partook of it with every appearance of
enjoyment, and was afterwards handed round to all the warriors in due
order. M. de la Gironi&egrave;re and his Tagal servant also partook of
this refreshment out of politeness to their hosts. The ceremony was
followed by a dance and a smoking concert, during which copious
libations of <i>basi</i> were consumed.</p>
<p>M. de la Gironi&egrave;re has omitted to mention how his hosts,
after this drunken orgy, managed to regain their elevated sleeping
quarters, sixty or eighty feet from the ground. One would think that
the Tinguian coroner would have been busy the next morning. He,
however, does tell us that, being unable to sleep, he got up in the
night and looked about him, finding a well or pit, which he descended.
At different levels in this shaft were short galleries or niches, and
in each of these was a dried or mummified corpse. This shaft was sunk
inside the house where he slept.</p>
<p>He learnt from the Tinguianes that they believed in the existence of
the soul, that it leaves the body after death, but remains in the
family. Also that they venerated any strange object, such as a rock or
tree which resembled some animal. They would make a hut over or near
it, and celebrate a feast, at which they sacrificed pigs; they
afterwards danced and drunk <i>basi</i>, then burnt down the hut and
retired. They had, he says, only one wife, but might have several
concubines, who, however, did not inhabit the conjugal domicile, but
each had a hut of her own. The riches of a Tinguian was demonstrated by
the number of porcelain vases he possessed. According to M. de la
Gironi&egrave;re, the Tinguianes mummified their dead by subjecting
them to a long drying process. The body, propped up on a stool, was
surrounded by braziers with charcoal or wood embers, and the moisture
which exuded from it was wiped off by the women with cotton. When the
body was well dried up it was kept above ground for fifteen days and
then committed to the tomb. The neighbours and friends kept up the wake
and pronounced eulogies on the defunct until they had consumed all the
eatables and liquor in the house, when they took their departure.</p>
<p>These people must have very greatly increased in numbers, as the
Spanish authority has extended its protection to them, checking the
incursions of the Guinanes and other savages. It has been stated that
in former years the Tinguianes were much sought after as recruits for
the garrison of Manila. They do not appear to be a warlike <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>race, yet so fine a body of men ought to be able
to supply a battalion of infantry for the native army which the United
States will have to raise, for nobody can suppose that 25,000 young
Americans can be permanently kept in garrison in the Archipelago. But
this I discuss in another chapter.</p>

<p class="first">This race was formerly very warlike, but is now more
civilized, and many even converted to Christianity. They inhabit the
mountainous region round about the River Apayao, on the east of the
Cordillera del Norte and extend down towards the plains of the Rio
Chico.</p>
<p>They pay some attention to agriculture, and besides growing
vegetables and maize for their own use, they raise tobacco and cacao
which they trade away to the Ilocanos in exchange for such articles as
they require.</p>
<p>Their houses compare favourably with those of the other hill-tribes.
They are raised to a considerable height, being square in form with
heavy hardwood posts at the corners. The floor is made of cedar planks,
the roof is thatched with cogon or reeds, and the walls and partitions
are of plaited palm leaves. A fire-place is arranged in one corner.
They ornament the walls with remarkable taste, hanging up the ornaments
and arms of their ancestors, which they greatly prize and will not part
with for any price.</p>
<p>They also highly value Chinese and Japanese pottery or porcelain.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span></p>
<p>Needless to say that the worship of ancestors is with them piously
performed.</p>
<p>They used to be head-hunters and made the death of any of their
chief men an excuse to lie in ambush and massacre any inoffensive
passers-by for the purpose of taking the heads to place round the
corpse and afterwards bury them with it.</p>
<p>However, the steady pressure of the Spanish authority, during long
terms of years, has nearly eradicated this detestable custom, and if
practised at all, it is only in the remoter fastnesses of the
mountains, where they cannot yet be controlled.</p>
<p>The Apayaos living in the plains are mostly reduced to obedience,
and many pay the poll-tax.</p>
<p>It would seem that there is a prospect of these people being

<h3 class="main">Catalanganes and Irayas (30&ndash;31).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Irayas live in scattered hamlets on the summits of
the Sierra Madre, and on its western slopes right down to the Rio
Grande. Their territory extends for about twenty geographical miles on
each side of the 17th parallel. Amongst them live many Negritos who
have renounced their nomadic life, and have adopted the manners and
customs of their hosts. The tattooing of the Irayas and Negritos is
similar. The Irayas are a Malay tribe amongst whom are found
individuals of a Mongolian type, others are hybrid Negrito Malays.</p>
<p>They do a little slovenly agriculture, using buffaloes for
ploughing. They catch an abundance of fish from the four considerable
streams running through their territory. They consume a large quantity
of fish with their rice, and salt and sell the surplus to their
neighbours. They are characteristically light-hearted and hospitable,
and readily receive <i>remontados</i> and other strangers. Their
religion is the usual Anito worship. They build wretched houses, and
are very dirty in their habits, throwing their refuse down in front of
the house.</p>
<p>The Catalanganes take their name from the River Catalangan which
runs into the Rio Grande near Ilagan. They are a branch of the Irayas,
but show a more strongly marked Mongolian type. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span></p>
<p>They are cleaner than the Irayas, and more industrious, and
provident, storing up provisions against a bad harvest.</p>
<p>Their fields are much better kept than those of the Irayas, and they
employ their spare time in felling trees and hewing them into canoes,
which find a ready sale at Ilagan.</p>
<p>They dress much like the Christian Malays, but are tattooed in
patterns of Chinese or Japanese origin.</p>
<p>Their laws prescribe severe penalties for theft and other crimes.
Their weapons are bows and arrows, and they are said to be very
cowardly. Their choice of weapons confirms this statement.</p>
<p>They differ much from the Irayas in character, for they are
inhospitable, avaricious and greedy, and of a gloomy disposition. On
the other hand, they keep their houses cleaner.</p>
<p>They have temples for worship, and some roughly-made monuments.
According to Semper, they have two pairs of gods which they specially
worship in June: Tschichenan, with his wife Bebenaugan, and Sialo with
his wife Binalinga. The usual ancestor-worship also prevails, and they
show great respect for the Anitos according to seniority, providing
special shelters and little benches near their houses for their
convenience.</p>
<p>Both <i>Irayas</i> and <i>Catalanganes</i> have Gobernadorcillos
appointed by the Spanish Military Governor of Isabela. They pay the
poll-tax, called by the Spaniards &ldquo;Acknowledgment of
Vassalage,&rdquo; but are otherwise independent and administer their
own laws and customs. They are quite peaceful, and will doubtless in
time advance in civilisation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"

They are civilised, and have been Christians for centuries.</p>
<p>They speak a dialect of their own, which, according to Jagor, is
midway between Tagal and Visay, which dialect is spoken in its greatest
purity by the inhabitants of the Isarog volcano and its immediate
neighbourhood, and that thence towards the west the dialect becomes
more and more like the Tagal, and towards the east like the Visay until
by degrees, before reaching the ethnographical boundary, it merges into
those kindred languages.</p>
<p>In manners and customs they appear to be half-bred between these two
races, yet, according to F. Blumentritt, they preceded the Tagals, and
were in fact the first Malays to arrive in Luzon. They show signs of
intermixture with Polynesian or Papuan stock.</p>
<p>They are physically inferior to the Tagals, nor do they possess the
proud warlike spirit of the dwellers in north Luzon. They are less

"pb284">284</a>]</span>of the <i>bolo</i>, but I did not see a
<i>kris</i> carried by any one when I visited the province.</p>
<p>In fact, the regulations enforced at that time by the Guardia Civil
were against carrying such a weapon. The <i>bolo</i>, on the other
hand, is a necessary tool.</p>
<p>I visited the province of Camarines Sur, going from Manila to
Pasacao by sea, and from there travelled by road to an affluent of the
River Vicol, and then by canoe on a moonlit night to Nueva
C&aacute;ceres, the capital of the province.</p>
<p>Here I met a remarkable man, the late Bishop Gainza, and was much
impressed by his keen intellect and great knowledge of the country.</p>
<p>He was said to be a man of great ambition, and I can quite believe
it. Originally a Dominican monk, it was intended that he should have
been made Archbishop of Manila, but, somehow, Father Pedro Paya, at
that time Procurator of the Order in Madrid, got himself nominated
instead, and Gainza had to content himself with the bishopric of Nueva
C&aacute;ceres.</p>
<p>He was a model of self-denial, living most frugally on a small part
of his revenue, contributing a thousand dollars a year to the funds of
the Holy Father, and spending the remainder in building or repairing
churches and schools in his diocese, or in assisting undertakings he
thought likely to benefit the province.</p>
<p>Amongst other works, I remember that he had tried to cut a canal
from the River Vicol to the Bay of Ragay. He had excavated a portion of
it, but either on his death, or from the difficulties raised by the
Public Works Department, the work was abandoned.</p>
<p>The Franciscan friars, who held the benefices in that province,
opposed him, and annoyed him in every possible way.</p>
<p>The present bishop, Father Arsenio Ocampo, formerly an Augustinian
monk, is a clever and enlightened man, with whom I had dealings when he
was Procurator-General of his Order.</p>
<p>I have made this digression from my subject, because so much has
been said against the clergy of the Philippines, that I feel impelled
to bring before my readers this instance of a bishop who constantly
endeavoured to promote the interests of his province.</p>
<p>Nueva C&aacute;ceres possessed several schools, a hospital, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>lepers&rsquo; hospital, and a training-college
for school-mistresses had just been established by Bishop
Gainza&rsquo;s initiative.</p>
<p>The shops were mostly in the hands of Chinese, who did a flourishing
trade in Manchester goods, <i>patadoins</i>, and coloured
handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>There were several Spanish and Mestizo merchants who dealt in hemp
and rice.</p>
<p>From Nueva C&aacute;ceres I travelled by a good road to Iriga, a
town near the volcano of that name, passing close to the Isarog on my
way. From Iriga I visited the country round about, and Lake Bula.</p>
<p>Some years after I went from Manila by sea to Tabaco, on the Pacific
coast of Albay, getting a fine night view of the Mayon volcano (8272
feet) in violent eruption.</p>
<p>From Tabaco I drove to Tivi and visited the celebrated boiling-well
and hot-springs at that place, much frequented by the natives, and
sometimes by Europeans, for the cure of rheumatism and other
diseases.</p>
<p>Now that the Stars and Stripes float over the Philippines it is to
be hoped that a regular sanatorium will be erected at this beautiful
and health-restoring spot, the advantages of which might attract
sufferers from all the Far East.</p>
<p>On these journeys I had a good opportunity of studying the people.
The chief exports are Abac&aacute; (Manila hemp), and rice. In
Camarines Sur the principal crop is rice, whilst in Albay the hemp
predominates, and they import rice.</p>
<p>The cultivation of rice, which I have briefly described when writing
of the Tagals, is not an occupation calculated to improve the minds or
bodies of those engaged in it, and I have noticed that wherever this is
the staple crop the peasantry are in a distinctly lower condition than
where cane is planted and sugar manufactured. Their lives are passed in
alternate periods of exhausting labour and of utter idleness, there is
nothing to strive for, nothing to learn, nothing to improve. The same
customs go on from generation to generation, the same rude implements
are used, and the husbandman paid for his labour in kind lives
destitute of comfort in the present, and without hope for the
future.</p>
<p>Nor can the cultivation and preparation of hemp be considered as a
much more improving occupation.</p>
<p>Little care, indeed, is required by the <i>Musa textilis</i> after
the first planting, and the cleaning of the fibre is a simple matter,
but very laborious. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286"
name="pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>Several Spaniards are settled in these provinces, also a few agents
of British houses in Manila, and some Chinese and Mestizos. They
usually complain bitterly of the difficulty they experience in getting
hemp delivered to them owing to the laziness and unpunctuality of the
natives.</p>
<p>Yet, notwithstanding this, most of them live in affluence and some
have amassed fortunes by Vicol labour. There is, in fact, a good deal
of money in Albay, Daraga, and other towns in the hemp districts, and
they are the happy hunting-ground of the Jew pedlar who there finds a
good market for yellow diamonds and off-colour gems unsaleable in
London or Paris. Houndsditch and Broadway will do well to note.</p>
<p>The peasantry, however, either from improvidence or aversion to
steady labour, seem to be rather worse off than the Tagals and
Pampangos, more especially those amongst them who cultivate paddy.</p>
<p>The whole of the large amount of hemp exported from Manila and
Ceb&uacute; is cleaned by hand.</p>
<p>Several attempts have been made to employ machinery, but the
inherent conditions of the industry are unfavourable to success in this
line.</p>
<p>The plants are grown principally on the eastern slopes of the
volcanic mountains of Southern Luzon, and the adjacent islands where
the soil is soft and friable and roads are unknown.</p>
<p>The heavy stems of the plants cannot profitably be conveyed to fixed
works for treatment, and no machine has yet been devised light enough
to be carried up to the <i>l&aacute;tes</i> or plantations and able to
compete with hand labour. In a recent report to the British North
Borneo Company, Mr. W. C. Cowie mentions his hopes that
Thompson&rsquo;s Fibre Company are about to send out a trial
decorticator, with engine and boiler to drive it, to the River Padas,
in that company&rsquo;s territories, for cleaning the fibre of the
numerous plants of the <i>Musa textilis</i> growing in that region. It
will be interesting to learn the result. Possibly the conditions of
transport by rail or river are more favourable than in the Philippines,
and in that case a measure of success is quite possible. But few errors
are more expensive than to unwarrantably assume that machinery must
necessarily be cheaper than hand labour.</p>

<p>Anyhow, as regards the Philippines here is a nice <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>little problem. If the mechanics of
Massachusetts and Connecticut cannot solve it, I do not know who
can.</p>
<p>The Vicol labourers proceed to the <i>l&aacute;tes</i> in couples,
carrying their simple and efficient apparatus, all of which, except the
knife, they make themselves.</p>
<p>One man cuts down the plant, removes the outer covering, and
separates the layers forming the stem, dividing them into strips about
one and a half inches wide, and spreading them out to air.</p>
<p>The other man standing at his bench, takes a strip and places the
middle of it across the convex block and under the knife, which is held
up by the spring of a sapling overhead. Then, placing one foot on a
treadle hanging from the handle of the knife, he firmly presses the
latter down on the block. It should be explained that the knife is not
sharp enough to cut the fibres. Firmly grasping the strip in both
hands, and throwing his body backwards, he steadily draws the strip
towards him till all the fibre has passed the knife; then, removing his
foot from the treadle, the knife is lifted from the block by the
spring, leaving the pulp and waste behind it. Sweeping this off, he
reverses the half-cleaned strip, and twisting the cleaned fibre round
one hand and wrist, and grasping it also with the other, he draws the
part he formerly held, under the knife, pressing the treadle with the
foot as before, and thus completes the cleaning of one strip. The fibre
is often six feet long, and only requires drying in the sun to be
marketable.</p>
<p>A man is able to clean about twenty-five pounds of hemp per day, and
receives one half of it for his labour.</p>
<p>He usually sells his share to his employer for a trifle under the
market price. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=

<h2 class="main">The Chinese in Luzon.</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="first">Mestizos or half-breeds.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Legaspi founded the city of Manila, in 1571, he
found that Chinese junks frequented the port, and carried on a trade
with Tondo and the other native towns.</p>
<p>Three years later, the Chinese pirate, Li-ma-hon, made an attack on
the new city with a force of 2000 men in ninety-five small vessels, but
was repulsed.</p>
<p>In 1603, the Chinese in Manila, under Eng-cang, rose against the
Spaniards, and entrenched themselves in the suburbs. The Spaniards
failed in the first assault with heavy loss, but ultimately the Chinese
were defeated, and 23,000 were massacred, the few remaining being made
galley-slaves. In 1639, another insurrection of the Chinese occurred
and again some 23,000 were massacred.</p>
<p>In 1662, in consequence of the Chinese pirate Cong-seng demanding
tribute from the governor of the Philippines, a decree was made that
all Chinese must leave. The Chinese, however, refused, and entrenched
themselves in the Parian, or market-place, outside the walls. They were
attacked, and many thousands were killed. A body of 2000 endeavoured to
march north, but were massacred by the Pampangos.</p>
<p>In 1762, when Manila was taken by the forces of the Honourable East
India Company, the Chinese eagerly joined in the plundering. It having
been rumoured that the Chinese intended to join the British forces, Don
Simon de Anda condemned them all to death, and most of them were hung,
their property passing to their executioners.</p>
<p>In 1820, there occurred the fifth and last massacre of the Chinese.
The mob of Manila took advantage of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>abject cowardice of
the acting-governor, General Folgueras, and of other authorities, and
for hours vented their spite on the unhappy Chinamen, showing them no
mercy, and carrying off their goods.</p>
<p>Since that time no general massacre has taken place, but such is the
dislike of the natives to the Chinese, that these latter would have
been quickly exterminated if the Spanish Government had failed at any
time to protect them.</p>
<p>The Chinese are mostly herded together in Manila, and in some of the
larger towns. Some few venture to keep stores in the villages, and
others travel about at the risk of their lives in the sugar, hemp and
tobacco districts, as purchasers and collectors of produce.</p>
<p>I consider that they should not be allowed to do this, for the
invariable result of their interference is to reduce the quality of
everything they handle. Their trade is based upon false weights and
measures, and upon adulteration, or insufficient preparation of the
produce. They are very patient with the natives, and this gives them a
very great advantage over a European, even if the latter is used to
Eastern ways. An American would probably have less patience than any
European in negotiating a purchase of produce from an up-country
native; the waste of time would exasperate him. I feel sure that most
of those who know the Philippines will agree with me as to the evil
results of the operations of the Chinese produce-brokers. Adulterated
sugar, half-rotten hemp, half-cured tobacco, badly-prepared
indigo&mdash;that is what the Chinaman brings in. He spoils every
article he trades in, and discredits it in the world&rsquo;s
markets.</p>
<p>The Chinese nowhere cultivate the soil, except the gardens and
market-gardens around Manila, and a few of the large towns.</p>
<p>This is, perhaps, not due to their unwillingness to do so, but
because they dare not; the natives are too jealous of them, and their
lives would not be safe away from the towns.</p>
<p>Their genius is commercial, and they are at home in shop, bazaar, or
office. I think that the Chinese agriculturist does not leave his home
for the Philippines. Most of those in the islands come from Amoy, and
the district round that port. Some few are from Macao; they seem to be
all townsmen, not countrymen. Each shopkeeper <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>has
several assistants, ranging in age from boys of ten or twelve upwards.
On arrival, they are placed in a sort of school&mdash;a very practical
one&mdash;to learn Spanish; for instance, numbers and coins, with such
terms as <i lang="es">Muy barato</i>&mdash;very cheap. As a Chinaman
cannot pronounce the letter R, but substitutes L, this becomes <i lang=
"es">Muy balato</i>. Thus, also, the Roo-Kiu Islands become the
Loo-Chew Islands, in Chinese.</p>
<p>The Chinaman is an excellent shop-keeper or pedlar, and some years
ago, the British importers of Manchester goods made it a practice to
give credit for goods supplied to the Chinese; the banks also extended
some facilities to them. In consequence, however, of heavy losses to
several British firms, this custom has been abandoned, or considerably
restricted.</p>
<p>The Chinese are good barbers, cooks and gardeners. As breeders of
fish they are unrivalled. Besides this they compete successfully with
the Tagal in the following trades: blacksmiths, boiler-makers, stokers,
engine-drivers, ship and house carpenters, boat-builders,
cabinet-makers and varnishers, iron and brass-founders, shoe-makers,
tin-smiths. These artisans are very industrious, and labour constantly
at their trades. Their great feast is at the Chinese New Year, which
occurs in February, when they take about a week&rsquo;s holiday, and
regale themselves on roast pig, and other delicacies, making also
presents of sweets, fruits, and Jocchiu hams, to their patrons and
customers.</p>
<p>There are Chinese apothecaries in Manila, but they are mostly
resorted to by their own countrymen, and their awful concoctions are
nasty beyond belief. They deal largely in aphrodisiacs.</p>
<p>Some Chinese doctors practise in Manila, and are said to make
wonderful cures, even on patients given up by the orthodox medicos.
They feel the pulse at the temporal artery, or else above the bridge of
the nose.</p>
<p>They used to suffer a good deal from the jealousy of the Spanish
practitioners, and were persecuted for practising without a
qualification.</p>
<p>Large numbers of Chinese coolies are employed in Manila handling
coal, loading and unloading ships and lighters, pressing hemp, drying
sugar, and in other work too hard and too constant for the natives.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese in Luzon has been variously <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>estimated at from 30,000 to 60,000 men, and two
or three hundred women. The anonymous author of
&lsquo;Filipinas&mdash;Problema Fundamental&rsquo; (Madrid, 1891),
gives the number of Chinese in the whole Archipelago as 125,000, and he
evidently had access to good information. The fact is nobody knows, and
in all probability the Spanish authorities had an interest in
understating the number.</p>
<p>The Chinese were organised quite separately from the natives.
Wherever their numbers were considerable, they had their own tribunal,
with a Gobernadorcillo and Principales, the former called the
Capitan-China.</p>
<p>In Manila, this Capitan was a man of importance, or else the nominee
of such a person. Certain governors-general received, nay, even
extorted, large sums from the Capitan-China. Weyler is said to have
been one of these offenders, but Jovellar caused the Capitan-China to
be turned out of Malaca&ntilde;an for offering him a present. No one
who knew them would ever believe that Moriones or Despujols would
condescend to accept presents from the Chinamen. One favourite trick of
the more corrupt governors-general was to have some very obnoxious law
made in Spain; for instance, obliging the Chinese to become
cabezas-de-barangay, or responsible tax-collectors of their own
countrymen, and then extort a ransom for not putting the law in force.
Weyler was said to have received $80,000 from the Chinese on this
account, but some of this would have to go to Madrid.</p>
<p>At another time it was proposed that the Chinese should be obliged
to keep their accounts in Spanish on books having every leaf stamped,
and that every firm should employ a trained accountant who had passed
an examination in book-keeping, and obtained a diploma as a commercial
expert. What it cost the Celestials to avoid this infliction I do not
know.</p>
<p>Amidst all this extortion from the Spaniard, and notwithstanding the
ever-present hatred of the native, the Manila Chinaman is a sleek and
prosperous-looking person, and seems cheerful and contented. If he
becomes wealthy he may very likely become a Christian, less, perhaps,
from any conviction or faith, but from motives of interest, and to
facilitate his marriage to a native woman, or half-caste. He invariably
selects an influential god-father, and dutifully takes him
complimentary presents on his feast-day, wife&rsquo;s feast-day, etc.
Baptism used to cost him a substantial fee, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>but
it brought him business, for the priests were good customers to him.
Now, however, with freedom of religion, with civil marriage and the
withdrawal of the friars, he may be able to marry without the trouble
of changing his religion.</p>
<p>Whether Christian or heathen, he usually keeps a few sticks of
incense burning before an image at the back of his shop, and
contributes to any subscription the priest may be raising.</p>
<p>I look upon the Chinaman as a necessity in the Philippines, but
consider that he must be governed by exceptional legislation, and not
be allowed to enter indiscriminately, nor to engage, as a matter of
course, in every calling.</p>
<p>If attempts are to be made to settle them on the land, great care
must be shown in selecting the localities, and great precautions taken
to prevent fighting between the Chinese and the natives. However, there
should be plenty of room for tens of thousands of agricultural
labourers in Palawan and Mindanao; but I consider women to be essential
to the success of such colonies. The family is the base of any
permanent settlement, and it ought to be made a condition that a
considerable number of women should come over with the men.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Mestizos, or Half-Breeds.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From the intercourse of Spanish and other Europeans
with the native women, there has sprung a race called Mestizo, or
Mestizo-Espanol. Similarly, the Chinese, by their alliance with native
women, have produced the Mestizo-Chino, or Sangley.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to say how many there are of these people, for
opinions differ widely. The anonymous author of a pamphlet called
&lsquo;Filipinas&rsquo; (Madrid, 1891), gives the number of Spanish
Mestizos in the Archipelago, in 1890, as 75,000, whilst he estimates
the number of Chinese Mestizos at no less than half a million. The
Spanish Mestizos vary much in appearance, character and education,
according to whether they have come under the influence of their father
or their mother. Many of them are people of considerable property, and
have been educated in Spain, Germany or England, or at the university
in Manila. Others have relapsed into the ordinary native life. As a
class they are possessed of much influence. Both in Manila <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>and
in the country towns they own large houses, and much landed property.
Their superior intelligence and education enables them to prosper in
business or in professions. Some of them are doctors of medicine, or
lawyers. A very few have studied engineering. Again, a fair number are
priests, and of these, some are men of great learning.</p>
<p>The Mestizos are the capitalists, which is to say the usurers of the
country. They have not personally participated much in the revolts
against the Spaniards, nor yet in the fighting against the Americans,
though they may have given small sums to assist the movement. They will
be there, though, when offices are to be distributed, and will make
hard masters, more oppressive, in fact, than any European or
American.</p>
<p>This is what M. Andr&eacute;, Belgian Consul-General, says of them:
&ldquo;This class is composed entirely of usurers and pawnees. All the
pawn-shops and gambling-houses belong to the principal Mestizo
families. There is not one family free from that stigma. In the
plantations belonging to the rich families of Mestizos or Indians, the
workmen are treated very inhumanly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the Spanish Mestizos are very unpopular
amongst the natives, and that an uncomfortable time would await them
should the islands become independent. They are perfectly aware of
this, and in their hearts long for the protection of one of the Great
Powers. At the same time, they are anxious to get the lion&rsquo;s
share of the loaves and fishes.</p>
<p>The Chinese Mestizos differ both in appearance and character from
the Spanish Mestizos, owning less land, and being more addicted to
commercial pursuits, for which both sexes show a remarkable aptitude.
It is customary for the daughters, even of wealthy families, to trade
on their own account from an early age. A case was mentioned to me
where five dollars was given to a young girl to begin trading. With
this she purchased a pilon of sugar, and sending out some of her
father&rsquo;s servants to the woods, collected a large quantity of
guavas. She then caused the cook to make the material into guava jelly,
which she packed in tins or jars collected for the purpose. Then
another servant took the jelly out for sale, and disposed of it all.
The capital was soon doubled, and invested in sayas and handkerchiefs
bought at wholesale prices, which were then hawked round by a servant.
Some years afterwards, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=
"#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>I made the acquaintance of this
young lady, and found that she was then dealing in diamond and pearl
jewellery, and had a large iron safe in which she kept her stock, which
was then worth several thousand dollars, all made by her trading.</p>
<p>Chinese Mestizos are owners of cascos and lorchas for loading or
unloading vessels, also of farderias, or establishments for mixing and
drying sugar.</p>
<p>In Manila, the Sangleyes, as they are called by the Spaniards and
natives, have a gobernadorcillo and tribunal of their own. In Santa
Cruz they are very numerous, and amongst them are to be found
jewellers, silversmiths, watch-makers, or rather repairers, sculptors,
gilders and painters, besides one or two dentists of good renown.

<p class="first">This name is given to the group of six considerable
islands lying between Luzon and Mindanao, and also to the race
inhabiting them. Beginning at the west, these islands are Panay,
Negros, Ceb&uacute;, Bohol, Leyte, and Samar. There are also a number
of smaller islands.</p>
<p>Many of the larger as well as the smaller islands are thickly
populated, and an extensive emigration takes place to the great and
fertile island of Mindanao, where any amount of rich land waits the
coming of the husbandmen. I can find no later records of population
than the census of 1877. This may seem strange to an American, but to
those who know the ignorance and ineptitude of the Spanish
administration, it will seem a matter of course. Such data of the
population as the Government Offices possess, are mostly due to the
priests and the archbishop.</p>
<p>Since 1877 there has undoubtedly been a great increase of population
amongst the Visayas, and in 1887 the population of Panay was considered
to be more than a million.</p>
<p>The Visayas Islands contain fewer heathen than any other part of the
Philippines. In Panay there are a few Negritos and Mundos; in Negros
some Negritos and Carolanos. The illustration opposite p. 207 is a
full-length photograph of Tek Taita, a Negrito from this island. In
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>Ceb&uacute; a few Mundos live around the peak of
Danao. In Bohol, Leyte, and Samar there are no heathen savages.</p>
<p>It may be said that the heathen in these islands would have died out
before now but that they are reinforced continually by
<i>remontados</i>, or fugitives from justice, also by people whose
inclination for a savage life, or whose love of rapine renders the
humdrum life of their village insupportable to them.</p>

<p><i>Panay.</i>&mdash;This island is approximately an equilateral
triangle, with the western edge nearly north and south, having one apex
pointing south. A chain of mountains extends in a curved line from the
northern to the southern point, enclosing an irregular strip of land
which forms the province of Antique. The rivers in this part of the
island are naturally short and unimportant. The northern part of the
island is the province of Capiz, the principal river is the Panay,
which, rising in the centre of the island, runs in a northerly
direction for over thirty miles, entering the sea at the Bay of Sapian.
The eastern and southern part of the island is the province of Ilo-ilo.
The principal river is the Talana, which, rising quite near the source
of the River Panay, runs in a southerly and south-easterly direction
into the channel between Negros and Panay to the north of the island of
Guimaras. There are many spurs to the principal range of mountains, but
between them is a considerable extent of land under cultivation. The
province of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>Ilo-ilo is one of the richest and most
densely-populated in the Philippines. It now contains at least half a
million inhabitants.</p>
<p>Ilo-ilo is open to foreign commerce, and vice-consuls of many
nations reside there. Yet the port has neither wharves, cranes,
moorings or lights. The coasting steamers drawing up to 13 feet enter a
muddy creek and discharge their cargo on the banks as best they can,
whilst the ocean-going ships lie out in the bay and receive their
cargoes of sugar and other produce from lighters, upon each of which
pilotage used to be charged for the benefit of an unnecessary number of
pilots, and of the captain of the port, who received a share of the
pilotage and strenuously resisted a reform of this abuse.</p>
<p>Under American protection, Ilo-ilo may be expected to become a
flourishing port, provided with every convenience for discharging,
loading, and repairing ships, as becomes the importance of its trade.
The town of Ilo-ilo contained many large buildings, some of them owned
by British subjects. During the fighting last year, however, several
buildings were burnt.</p>
<p>During the Spanish rule the streets were entirely uncared for, being
a series of mud-holes in the rainy season, and thick with dust and
garbage in the dry season.</p>
<p>The town and port together are notorious examples of all the worst
characteristics of Spanish rule.</p>
<p>The principal towns of this wealthy province are Pototan, Santa
Barbara, Janiuay, and Cabatuan, each of which has more than 20,000
inhabitants.</p>
<p>The industries and productions of this and the other islands are
treated of under Visayas when describing the inhabitants.</p>
<p><i>Negros.</i>&mdash;A long island of irregular shape, lying between
Panay and Ceb&uacute;. Its axis is nearly north and south, and a chain
of mountains runs up it, but nearer to the east than to the west
coast.</p>
<p>A little to the north of the centre of this chain, the celebrated
volcano Canlaon raises its peak over 8300 feet. It is frequently in
active eruption, and can be perceived at an immense distance when the
atmosphere is clear. I have seen it and its long plume of vapour from a
steamer when passing the north of the island.</p>
<p>In the Sierra de Dumaguete, a range occupying the centre of the
southern promontory of the island, and about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>the
centre of the range, there is the volcano of Bacon, about which little
is known.</p>
<p><i>Ceb&uacute;</i> is a long and narrow island something in the
shape of an alligator, looked at from above, with the snout pointing to
the southward and westward. It is opposite to Negros, and separated
from that island by the Strait of Tanon. It is, in fact, a range of
mountains rising out of the sea, and is very narrow, being nowhere more
than 22 miles wide. There being a large population of Visayas, and the
mountains not being very high, the wandering heathen have to a great
extent been weeded out, and only a remnant of wretched Mundos remain
about the crests of the cordillera.</p>
<p>The capital city, Ceb&uacute;, was the first in the Archipelago to
possess a municipality, and was, in fact, until 1571, the capital of
the Philippines.</p>
<p>It possesses some fine buildings; is the seat of a bishop, and
formerly of the Governor-General of Visayas. It is open to foreign
commerce, and vice-consuls of the principal nations reside there.</p>
<p>There can be no rivers in an island of this configuration, for the
water runs away as from the roof of a house. The crops and industries
have been spoken of under the head of <i>Visayas</i>.</p>
<p>There are considerable beds of lignite near Compostela, and various
efforts have been made to work them, so far, I fear, without much
success. Remarkable shells, and some pearls are obtained round about
Ceb&uacute; and the adjacent islands.</p>
<p><i>Bohol</i> lies off the southern half of the eastern coast of
Ceb&uacute;, and is only half the size of that island, but it has more
than half the population. It is hilly, and the towns and villages are
situated on the coast. Only the southern and eastern coast is visited
by coasting vessels, the navigation to the north and west being impeded
by a labyrinth of coral reefs. The soil of this island is not rich, and
the more enterprising of the natives emigrate to Mindanao.</p>
<p><i>Leyte</i> is an island of very irregular shape&mdash;something
like a hide pegged out on the ground&mdash;and lies between the
northern half of Ceb&uacute; and the southern part of Samar, from which
it is only separated by a very narrow passage called the Janabatas
Channel, and the Strait of San Juanico. The southern extremity of Leyte
approaches the northern promontory of Mindanao, and forms the Straits
of Surigao, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299"
name="pb299">299</a>]</span>second entrance from the Pacific to the
seas of the Archipelago. The island is mountainous, and has two lakes,
one called Bito is at the narrowest part, and one called Jaro, near the
town of that name. There are several good ports. The exports, which go
to Manila, are hemp and sulphur of great purity.</p>
<p><i>Samar.</i>&mdash;This is the largest of the Visayas, and yet has
fewest inhabitants. It lies to the eastward of all the other islands,
and consequently its east coast, like that of Luzon and Mindanao, is
exposed to the full fury of the north-east monsoon, and to the ravages
of the heavy rollers of the Pacific that burst without warning on its
rocky coast.</p>
<p>Its chief port, Catbalogan, is situated on the western coast, and is
well-sheltered. From the coast many lofty peaks are visible, but the
interior of this island is little known. The exports are hemp and
cocoa-nut oil. The northern point of Samar approaches the southern
extremity of Luzon, and forms the historic Strait of San Bernardino,
one of the entrances to the Philippine Archipelago from the Pacific. It
was by this Strait that the annual galleon from Acapulco entered, and
here also the British privateers lay in wait for their silver-laden
prey. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=

<h2 class="main">Chapter XXXIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Visayas Race.</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="first">Appearance&mdash;Dress&mdash;Look upon Tagals as
foreigners&mdash;Favourable opinion of Tomas de Comyn&mdash;Old
Christians&mdash;Constant wars with the Moro pirates and Sea
Dayaks&mdash;Secret heathen rites&mdash;Accusation of indolence

sugar&mdash;Ceb&uacute; sugar&mdash;Textiles&mdash;A promising
race.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most numerous and, after the Tagals, the most
important race in the Philippines is the Visaya, formerly called
Pintados, or painted men, from the blue painting or tattooing which was
prevalent at the time of the conquest. They form the mass of the
inhabitants of the islands called Visayas and of some others.</p>
<p>They occupy the south coast of Masbate, the islands of Romblon,
Bohol, Sibuyan, Samar, and Leyte, Tablas, Panay, Negros, and
Ceb&uacute;, all the lesser islands of the Visayas group and the
greater part of the coast of the great island of Mindanao. In that
island the Caragas, a very warlike branch of the Visayas, occupy the
coast of the old kingdom of Caraga on the east from Punta Cauit to
Punta San Agustin.</p>
<p>Another branch of the Visayas distinguished by a darker colour and
by a curliness of the hair, suggesting some Negrito mixture, occupies
the Calamiancs and Cuyos Islands, and the northern coasts of Paragua or
Palawan as far as Bahia Honda.</p>
<p>In appearance the Visayas differ somewhat from the Tagals, having a
greater resemblance to the Malays of Borneo and Malacca. The men wear
their hair longer than the Tagals, and the women wear a <i>patadion</i>
instead of a saya and tapis.</p>
<p>The patadion is a piece of cloth a yard wide and over <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>two
yards long, the ends of which are sewn together. The wearer steps into
it and wraps it round the figure from the waist downward, doubling it
over in front into a wide fold, and tucking it in securely at the
waist. The <i>saya</i> is a made skirt tied at the waist with a tape,
and the <i>tapis</i> is a breadth of dark cloth, silk or satin, doubled
round the waist over the saya.</p>
<p>In disposition they are less sociable and hospitable than the
Tagals, and less clean in their persons and clothing. They have a
language of their own, and there are several dialects of it. The basis
of their food is rice, with which they often mix maize. They flavour
their food with red pepper to a greater extent than the Tagals. They
are expert fishermen, and consume large quantities of fish. In smoking
and chewing betel they resemble the other races of the islands. They
are great gamblers, and take delight in cock-fighting. They are fond of
hunting, and kill numbers of wild pig and deer. They cut the flesh of
the latter into thin strips and dry it in the sun, after which it will
keep a long time. It is useful to take as provision on a journey, but
it requires good teeth to get through it.</p>
<p>The Visayas build a number of canoes, paraos, barotos, and vintas,
and are very confident on the water, putting to sea in their ill-found
and badly-equipped craft with great assurance, and do not come to grief
as often as might be expected. Their houses are similarly constructed
to those of the other inhabitants of the littoral.</p>
<p>Ancient writers accused the Visaya women of great sensuality and
unbounded immorality, and gave details of some very curious customs,
which are unsuitable for general publication. However, the customs I
refer to have been long obsolete among the Visayas, although still
existing amongst some of the wilder tribes in Borneo. The Visaya women
are very prolific, many having borne a dozen children, but infant
mortality is high, and they rear but few of them. The men are less
sober than the Tagals&mdash;they manufacture and consume large
quantities of strong drink. They are not fond of the Tagals, and a
Visaya regiment would not hesitate to fire upon them if ordered. In
fact the two tribes look upon each other as foreigners. When discovered
by the Spaniards, they were to a great extent civilised and organised
in a feudal system. Tomas de Comyn formed a very favourable opinion of
them&mdash;he writes, both men and women are well-mannered and of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>good disposition, of better condition and nobler
behaviour than those of the Island of Luzon and others adjacent.</p>
<p>They had learnt much from Arab and Bornean adventurers, especially
from the former, whose superior physique, learning, and sanctity, as
coming from the country of the Prophet, made them acceptable suitors
for the hands of the daughters of the Rajas or petty kings. They had
brought with them the doctrines of Islam, which had begun to make some
converts before the Spanish discovery. The old Visaya religion was not
unlike that of the Tagals, they called their idols Dinatas instead of
Anitos&mdash;their marriage customs were not very different from those
of the Tagals.</p>
<p>The ancestors of the Visayas were converted to Christianity at, or
soon after, the Spanish conquest. They have thus been Christians for
over three centuries, and in constant war with the Mahometan pirates of
Mindanao and Sulu, and with the Sea Dayaks of Borneo. However, in some
localities they still show a strong hankering after witchcraft, and
practise secret heathen rites, notwithstanding the vigilance of the
parish priests.</p>
<p>A friar of the order of Recollets who had held a benefice in Bohol,
assured me that they have a secret heathen organisation, although every
member is a professing Christian, taking the Sacrament on the great
feasts of the Church. They hold a secret triennial meeting of their
adherents, who come over from other islands to be present. The meeting
is held in some lonely valley, or on some desert island, where their
vessels can lie concealed, always far from any church or priest. All
the Recollet could tell me about the ceremonies was that the sacrifice
of pigs formed an important part of it</p>
<p>The Visayas are no less credulous than the Tagals, for in Samar,
during my recollection, there have been several disturbances caused by
fanatics who went about in rags, and by prayers, incoherent speeches,
and self-mortification acquired a great reputation for sanctity. The
poor ignorant people, deluded by these impostors, who gave themselves
out to be gods, and as such, impervious to bullets, and immortal,
abandoned their homes and followed these false gods wherever they went,
listening to their wild promises, and expecting great miracles. They
soon came into collision with the Guardia Civil; and on one occasion,
armed only with clubs and knives, they made a determined charge on a
small party of this corps under the command of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>native officer. The Guardia Civil formed across
the road and poured several steady volleys into the advancing crowd,
breaking them up and dispersing them with heavy loss and killing the
false god. The native officer received the laurel-wreathed cross of San
Fernando as a reward for his services.</p>
<p>The Visayas are taxed with great indolence, yet they are almost the
only working people in districts which export a great quantity of
produce. Leyte and Samar produce a good many bales of excellent hemp,
and it should be remembered that every bale represents at least twelve
days&rsquo; hard work of one man in cleaning the fibre only, without
counting the cultivation, conveyance to the port, pressing, baling, and
shipping.</p>
<p>In Negros and Panay the sugar estates are much larger than in Luzon,
and mostly belong to Spaniards or mestizos. They are not worked by
<i lang="es">aparceria</i> as in Luzon, but the labourers are paid by
the day. Great troubles often occur as bands of labourers present
themselves on the plantations and offer to work, but demand an advance
of pay. Sometimes, after receiving it, they work a few days and then
depart without notice, leaving the planter in great difficulty and
without redress. Strict laws against vagrants are urgently required in
Visayas. On the other hand the planter is more free to introduce
improvements and alterations than when working by aparceria when he has
to consult the <i lang="es">inquilino</i> or cultivator about any
change. The cane-mills are much larger than in Luzon, and are mostly
worked by steam engines.</p>
<p>The sugar is handled differently from the custom of Pampanga.
Pilones are not used, and no manipulation in <i lang="es">farderias</i>
is required to prepare it for export. The cane-juice is carefully
clarified and skimmed, then boiled in open pans to a much higher point
than when making pilon-sugar, and to get it to this point without
burning or over-heating much care and experience is required.</p>
<p>From the teache it is ladled into large wooden trays, always in thin
layers, and is there beaten up with heavy spatulas until it becomes, on
cooling, a pale yellow amorphous mass. It is packed in mat-bags, and is
then ready for shipment. It travels well and loses but little during a
Voyage to San Francisco or New York. None of it goes to England, which
is now entirely supplied by the vile beet sugar &ldquo;made in
Germany,&rdquo; except for a few hundred <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb304" href="#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span>tons of Demerara
crystals imported for use by connoisseurs to sweeten their coffee.</p>
<p>Ilo-ilo sugar is shipped under three marks, No. 1, No. 2, No. 3. An
assortment or cargo of this sugar should consist of 1&ndash;8th No. 1,
2&ndash;8ths No. 2, 5&ndash;8ths No. 3.</p>
<p>A representative analysis of Ilo-ilo sugar is as follows:</p>

<p>In Ceb&uacute; the properties are small and are mostly in the hands
of Visayas. There are, perhaps, five or six steam-mills, but most of
the cane is ground in cattle-mills. They follow the practice of negroes
in making sugars direct for export, but the produce is of a lower
quality. An analysis of the Ceb&uacute; sugar is as follows:</p>

<p>Ilo-ilo and Ceb&uacute; are the principal ports in the Visayas
territory. Besides what they shipped to Manila in 1897, they exported
directly to the United States, Great Britain, or other countries, the
following: Ilo-ilo, 127,744 tons of sugar; 51,300 piculs of Sapan wood;
Ceb&uacute;, 15,444 tons of sugar; 80,271 bales of hemp; 46,414 piculs
of Copra. And <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>it must be remembered that the Visayas cultivate
most of the rice, maize, and other food-stuffs which they consume, and
also make their own instruments of agriculture. Besides this, Ilo-ilo
exported to other parts of the Philippines a million dollars&rsquo;
worth of textiles of cotton, silk, and other fibres, made by the
Visayas women in hand-looms. The women in Antique make the finest
pi&ntilde;a, a beautiful transparent texture of the utmost delicacy,
woven from the fibres of the leaves of a non-fruiting pine
(<i>ananas</i>). When doing the finest work they have to keep their
doors and windows closed, for the least draught would break or
disarrange the delicate filaments. The export from other ports in
Visayas of textiles of cotton and silk is considerable, and, in
addition to what they sell, the Visayas women weave most of the
material for their own clothing and for that of the men.</p>
<p>The Visayas also export mat-bags for sugar, which are called
bayones; mats for sleeping on, called petates or esteras; pillows
stuffed with cotton, hides, mother-of-pearl shell, Balate
(<i>B&egrave;che de Mer</i>), edible bird&rsquo;s-nests, gutta-percha,
gum-dammar, wax, rattans, coffee (of indifferent quality), and leaf
tobacco. Both the island of Panay and the coasts of Negros are dotted
over with cane plantations.</p>
<p>The Visayas extract oil from cocoa-nuts and forge excellent weapons
from scrap iron. The bands from bales of Manchester goods are much
esteemed for this purpose.</p>
<p>If we take all these points into consideration, the Visayas may not
appear so deplorably indolent as they have been said to be. When
writing of the other races, I have pointed out that the indolence
imputed to them rather goes beyond what is warranted by the facts.</p>
<p>It will be understood that there are degrees in the civilisation of
the Visayas, and as amongst the Tagals and other races, considerable
differences will be found to exist between the dwellers in the towns
and those in the outlying hamlets, whilst the Remontados may be
considered to have relapsed into savagery.</p>
<p>The Visayas do a certain amount of trade with the heathen hill-men
of their islands, and as will be pointed out when describing these
tribes, it is hard to say whether the Christian Visayas or the
Mahometan Malays rob these poor savages more shamefully.</p>
<p>The Visayas are a promising race, and I feel sure that when they
have a good government that will not extort too <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>heavy taxes from them, nor allow the native and
half-caste usurers to eat them up, their agriculture and industries
will surprisingly increase.</p>
<p>It is to the Visayas that the American Government must look to
provide a militia that will now hold in check, and ultimately
subjugate, the piratical Moros of Mindanao and Paragua. The fighting
qualities of this race, developed by centuries of combat with their
Mahometan aggressors in defence of hearths and homes, will be found
quite sufficient if they are well armed and led to make an end of the
Moro power within a very few years.</p>
<p>That this aspiration is one well worthy of the countrymen of
Decatur, will, I think, be admitted by all who have read my description
of the Moros under the heading of Mindanao. <span class=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The island of Palawan, or, as it is called by the
Spaniards, La Paragua, is situated between the parallels 8&deg;
25&prime; and 11&deg; 30&prime; N. lat. The capital, Puerto Princesa,
was founded in 1872, and is situated on the east coast in lat. 9&deg;
45&prime;, being 354 miles from Manila, 210 miles from North Borneo,
and 510 miles from Singapore. Palawan is about 250 miles long, and from
10 to 25 wide, with an area of about 5833 square miles, the third in
size of the Philippine Islands. There are several good ports in the
northern part, which is much broken up, and its coasts studded with
numerous islets, forming secure anchorages.</p>
<p>Off the western coast is a large submarine bank, with many coral
reefs and islets. The navigation on this coast is very dangerous, and
can only be done in daylight.</p>
<p>The harbour of Puerto Princesa is an excellent one, and sufficiently
large for all requirements.</p>
<p>Limestone and other sedimentary formations predominate. No volcanic
rocks are known to exist. It is conjectured that the island has been
formed by an upheaval, and it bears little resemblance geologically to
any of the other Philippines. Plastic clays suitable for making bricks,
tiles, and pottery, abound.</p>
<p>Nothing is known about the mineralogy, except that rock-crystal is
found, a magnificent specimen of great purity and value was sent from
the island to the Madrid Exhibition of 1887.</p>
<p>A chain of mountains, with peaks of varying elevation up to 6500
feet, runs lengthways of the island, much nearer <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>to
the western coast than to the eastern. The descent from the summits to
the eastern coast is, therefore, gradual, and on the western coast it
is abrupt. Mount Staveley, Mount Beaufort (3740 feet), Pico Pulgar
(4330 feet), and the Peaks of Anepalian, are in the central part of the
island.</p>
<p>The following record is taken from the observations made by Captain
Canga-Arguelles, a former governor, during his residence of three years
in Puerto Princesa.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the temperature is not excessive, and that the
distribution of the rainfall is favourable to agriculture and planting.
The force of the monsoon is much spent when it arrives on the coast of
Paragua, and the typhoons only touch the northern extremity of the
island.</p>
<p>Volcanic phenomena are unknown, and there is no record of
earthquakes.</p>
<p>From the lay of the island there is always one coast with calm
water, whichever way the monsoon is blowing.</p>
<p>The troops and civil population of Puerto Princesa suffer to some
extent from intermittent fevers; but the reports of the military,
naval, and civil infirmaries, state that the disease is not very
severe, and that it yields to treatment, and this assertion is
confirmed by the reports of the French travellers, Drs. Montano and Rey
and M. Alfred Marche.</p>
<p>The northern part of the island has been colonised from the other
Philippines, and the Christian inhabitants number <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>about 10,000 distributed amongst several small
villages. The southern coasts are occupied by Mahometan Malays, who
number about 6000, and the rest of this large island, except Puerta
Princesa, is only populated by savages, the principal tribes being

<p>This gives a grand total of 28,000 inhabitants, or 5.6 to the square
mile. In the island of Luzon, in which extensive districts are
uncultivated and unexplored, the mean density of the population in
1875, was 76.5 per square mile, and in the provinces of Batangan and
Pasgasinan, which are, perhaps, the best cultivated, the density was
272 inhabitants to the square mile.</p>
<p>The fauna has been studied to some extent, a French collector having
resided for a considerable period on the island. It comprises monkeys,
pigs, civets, porcupines, flying squirrels, pheasants, and a small
leopard, this latter not found in any other of the Philippines, and
showing a connection with Borneo.</p>
<p>The island is covered with dense forests, which have been little
explored.</p>
<p>The Inspeccion de Montes (Department of Woods and Forests) gives a
list of 104 different kinds of forest-trees known to be growing there,
and states that ebony abounds there more than in any other province of
the Philippines. According to Wallace, the camphor-tree is found in the
island.</p>
<p>Amongst the timbers mentioned in the Woods and Forests lists are
ebony, camagon, teak, cedar, dungon, banaba, gu&iacute;jo, molave, and
many others of value. The forest or jungle-produce will comprise:
charcoal, firewood, bamboos, rattans, nipa (attap), orchids, wax, gums,
resins, and camphor. Edible birds&rsquo;-nests are found in various
localities. Fish is abundant in the waters, and balate (<i lang=
"fr">B&egrave;che de mer</i>) is collected on the shores and reefs.</p>
<p>Puerto Princesa is visited by a mail steamer from Manila once in
twenty-eight days. A garrison of two companies of infantry was kept
there, and several small gun-boats were stationed there, which went
periodically <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>round the island. Piracy was completely
suppressed, and the Mahometan Malays were kept in good order by the
Spanish forces.</p>
<p>The dense primeval forests which have existed for ages, untouched by
the hand of man, undevastated by typhoons, volcanic eruptions, or
earthquakes, must necessarily have produced an enormous quantity of
decayed vegetable matter, rich in humus, and such a soil on a limestone
subsoil, mixed with the detritus washed down from the mountains, may
reasonably be expected to be of the highest fertility, and, perhaps, to
be equal to the richest lands of the earth, most specially for the
cultivation of tobacco.</p>
<p>The varied climates to be found from the sea-level to the tops of
the mountains should allow the cultivation of maize, rice, sugar-cane,
cotton, cacao, coffee, and hemp, each in the zone most favourable to
its growth and fruitfulness. The exemption from typhoons enjoyed by
this region is most important as regards the cultivation of the
aborescent species, and the cocoa-nut palm would prove highly
remunerative on land not suited for other crops.
<i>Tagban&uacute;as.</i></p>
<p>The Tagban&uacute;as are said to be the most numerous of the
inhabitants of Palawan. I understand that this word comes from
<i>Taga</i>, an inhabitant, and <i>banua</i>, country, and therefore
means an original inhabitant of the country, as opposed to later
arrivals.</p>
<p>They inhabit the district between <span class="corr" id="xd20e10866"
title="Source: Inagahuan">Inag&aacute;huan</span>, on the east coast,
and Ulugan and Apurahuan, on the west coast. Their numbers in 1888 were
estimated at 6000. In 1890 I spent ten days amongst these people, and
employed a number of them as porters to carry my tent, provisions, and
equipment, when travelling on foot through the forests to report on the
value of a concession in the neighbourhood of Yuahit and
Inag&aacute;huan. I therefore describe them from personal knowledge.
They are of a yellowish colour, and generally similar to the Mahometan
Malays of Mindanao. Those who have settled down and cultivated land
have a robust and healthy appearance; but those who are nomadic, mostly
suffered from skin diseases, and some were quite emaciated. Their
Maestro de Campo, the recognised head of their tribe, lived near
Inag&aacute;huan, and I visited him at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>his house, and found
him quite communicative through an interpreter.</p>
<p>Maestro de Campo is an obsolete military rank in Spain, and a
commission granting this title and an official staff, is sometimes
conferred by the Governor-General of the Philippines, or even by the
King of Spain, upon the chiefs of heathen tribes, who have supported
the Spanish forces against the pirates of Sul&uacute;, Mindanao, or
Palawan. Sometimes a small pension accompanies the title.</p>
<p>I also learnt much about the Tagban&uacute;as from a solitary
missionary, a member of the Order of Recollets, Fray Lorenzo Zapater,
who had resided more than two years amongst them, and had built a
primitive sort of church at Inag&aacute;huan.</p>
<p>They are sociable and pacific; their only weapons are the
<i>cerbatana</i>, or blow-pipe, with poisoned darts, and bows and
arrows, for the knives they carry are tools and not weapons. They do
not make war amongst themselves, but formerly fought sometimes to
defend their possessions against the piratical Mahometans, who inhabit
the southern part of the island. These heartless robbers, for centuries
made annual raids upon them, carrying off the paddy they had stored for
their subsistence, and everything portable worth taking. They seized
the boys for slaves, to cultivate their lands, and the girls for
concubines, killing the adults who dared to resist them. However, since
the establishment of a naval station and the penal colony at Puerto
Princesa in 1872, the coast has been patrolled by the Spanish gun-boats
and the piratical incursions have come to an end. The nomadic
Tagban&uacute;as, both men and women, were quite naked, except for a
cloth (<i>tapa-rabo</i>) which the men wore, whilst the women wore a
girdle, from which hung strips of bark or skin reaching nearly to the
knees. Round their necks they wore strings of coloured beads, a
turquoise blue seemed to be the favourite kind, and on their arms and
ankles, bangles made of brass wire. Coming out of the forest into a
clearing where there were two small huts built in the usual manner, and
another constructed in the fork of a large tree, I found a group of
these people threshing paddy. Amongst them were two young women with
figures of striking symmetry, who, on being called by the interpreter,
approached my party without the slightest timidity or embarrassment,
although wearing only the fringed girdle. I learnt that they had both
been baptized <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>but on asking the taller girl her name, instead
of answering me, she turned to her companion and said to her,
&ldquo;What is my name?&rdquo; to which the other answered,
&ldquo;Ursula.&rdquo; I then asked the shorter girl her name, and she
also, instead of answering me, asked the other girl, &ldquo;What is my
name?&rdquo; to which the taller one answered, &ldquo;Margarita.&rdquo;
These names had recently been given them instead of their heathen
names, and I could not be sure whether they had forgotten their new
names or whether, as is the case in several tribes, they must never
pronounce their own names nor the names of their ancestors. They
thankfully accepted a cigarette each, which they immediately
lighted.</p>
<p>On the following Sunday, these girls came to Mass at the
Inag&aacute;huan Church, completely dressed like Tagal women, and
although they passed in front of me, I did not recognize them until I
was told, for they looked much shorter.</p>
<p>When the missionary accompanied me to visit any of these people, I
observed that as we approached a house the people were hurriedly
putting on their clothes to receive us, but they were evidently more at
ease in the garb of Adam before the fall.</p>
<p>The Tagban&uacute;as have no strong religious convictions, and can
be easily persuaded to allow their children to be baptised. The
population of Inag&aacute;huan and Abortan at the time of my visit was,
according to the missionary, 1080, of whom 616 were baptised. But from
this number many had been taken away by their half-caste or Chinese
creditors to Lan&uacute;gan, a <i lang="es">visita</i> of Trinitian, to
collect wax and alm&aacute;ciga&mdash;the forests near Inag&aacute;huan
and Yu&aacute;hit being entirely exhausted. The heathen
Tagban&uacute;as believe in future rewards and punishment, and call the
infernal regions <i>basaud</i>. They believe in a Great Spirit, the
creator and preserver, who presides over all the important acts of
life. They call him Maguindose, and make offerings to him of rice and
fish. Polygamy is allowed amongst them, but from what I saw is not much
practised. When a Tagban&uacute;a proposes marriage to the object of
his affections, he leaves at the door of her hut the fresh trunk of a
banana plant. If she delays answering till the trunk has withered, he
understands this as a negative, and the damsel is spared the pain of
verbally refusing; but if she approves of his suit, she sends him her
answer in good time.</p>
<p>The lover then conveys to the house of the bride&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>parents, where all her relations are assembled,
large baskets of boiled rice. He takes a morsel of this and places it
in the mouth of the girl, she then does the same to him, and by this
symbolic act they assume the responsibilities of matrimony. This
particular ceremony is common to many Philippine tribes. The remainder
of the cooked rice furnishes the basis of the marriage feast.</p>
<p>They are said to cruelly punish adultery; on the other hand, divorce
is easily obtained.</p>
<p>When one of their number is very ill, they get up a concert (?) of
gongs and drums with the hope of curing him, and during the performance
nobody must approach the patient&rsquo;s couch. I could not learn
whether the music was intended to cheer up the sick person, or to
frighten away the evil spirit, which they look upon as the cause of his
malady; but I incline to the latter belief, because the so-called music
is calculated to frighten away any living thing.</p>
<p>If, however, the patient does not improve, he is then consulted as
to where he would like to be buried, and about other details of the
ceremony and funeral feast. This reminds me that I have read of a
Scotchwoman consulting her dying husband as to whether the scones to be
made for his funeral should be square or round. Such, however, is the
custom of the Tagban&uacute;as.</p>
<p>Immediately after death the relatives place by the corpse the
weapons and effects belonging to the deceased and sprinkle ashes on the
floor all around&mdash;then they retire and leave the dead alone for a
time. Later on, they return and carefully examine the ashes to see
whether the soul of the defunct, when abandoning the body, left any
foot-marks.</p>
<p>Then, forming a circle round the dead, they chant a dirge in honour
of the departed, after which they commit his body to the earth in the
midst of his cleared land, unless he has selected some other spot,
burying with him his arms and utensils, not forgetting the wood-knife
and a liberal ration of cooked rice and condiments for his journey to
the other world. They then abandon both hut and land and never return
to it. They bury small children in jars called <i>basinganis</i>.</p>
<p>I was much interested in these people, and felt a great pity for
them. All energy and determination seemed to have been crushed out of
them by centuries of oppression <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314"
href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>from their predatory
neighbours, and when at last the Spanish gun-boats delivered them from
these periodical attacks, they were held in what was practically
slavery by their half-caste or Chinese creditors. The respectability of
a Tagban&uacute;a is measured by the weight of gongs he possesses, just
as the importance of a Malay pirate-chief depends on the weight of
brass-guns he owns.</p>
<p>The half-castes, or Chinese, will supply them with a brass-gong
worth, say $5, for which they charge them thirty dollars to account.
This must be paid in alm&aacute;ciga (gum-dammar) at $5 per picul.
Consequently the poor savage has to supply six piculs of almaciga. Now
this gum was worth $12 per picul in Singapore, and the freight was
trifling. Consequently the savage pays the greedy half-caste, or
avaricious Chinaman, $72 worth of gum (less expenses) for a $5 gong,
and these rascally usurers take care that the savage never gets out of
their debt as long as he lives, and makes his sons take over his debt
when he dies. These terms are considered very moderate indeed; when I
come to speak of Mindanao I shall quote some much more striking trade
figures. Many of the traders there would think it very bad business to
get only $72 for goods costing $5.</p>
<p>Instead, therefore, of being allowed to till their land, these
people are hurried off to the most distant and least accessible forests
to dig for alm&aacute;ciga. This gum is found in crevices in the earth
amongst the roots of secular trees. I was assured that deposits had
been found of 25 piculs in one place&mdash;more than a ton and a half,
but such finds are rare, as the gum is now scarce. The savage has to
hide or guard his treasure when found, and he or his family must
transport it on their backs for twenty, thirty, or forty miles, as the
case may be, making repeated journeys to deliver it to their creditor.
I think this hard work, and want of good food, explains the emaciation
I noticed amongst these people. Some few of them were not in debt. Near
<span class="corr" id="xd20e10923" title=
"Source: Inagah&uacute;an">Inag&aacute;huan</span>, I found a man named
Amasa who had a small cane-field, and was at work squeezing the cane
with a great lever-press, which reminded me of the wine-presses in
Teneriffe. The lever was made of the trunk of a tree; the fulcrum was a
growing tree, whilst the pressing block was a tree-stump hollowed at
the top. The juice was boiled to a thick syrup, and found a ready sale
in the neighbourhood. Amasa was the biggest and strongest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>man
I saw amongst the Tagban&uacute;as, and stood five feet nine inches
high. He possessed a comfortable house and clothes, yet he accompanied
me on one of my journeys as a porter, but the exposure at night was too
much for him, and he had an attack of fever when he returned. Near
Amasa lived a Christian woman named Ignacia, a widow. She had lived ten
years in one place, and had an abundant supply of paddy stored in huge
baskets in her house. She also had a plantation of cacao trees, many of
them in full bearing. They were rather neglected, but had grown
remarkably. I bought some of her produce for my own use.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find that the Tagban&uacute;as could read and
write; one day I observed a messenger hand to one of them a strip of
bark with some figures scratched on it, which the latter proceeded to
read, and on inquiring from the missionary, I learnt that they had an
alphabet of sixteen or seventeen letters. I obtained a copy of this
from the Padre Zapater, and it will be found on page 319. They do not
use a pen, but scratch the letters with the point of a knife, or with a
nail, or thorn.</p>
<p>The Tagban&uacute;as are very fond of music and dancing. On the
evening of my arrival at Yuahit, a collection of about a dozen huts
with forty inhabitants, they gave an open-air performance in my honour.
My party consisted of a boat&rsquo;s-crew of eight Tagal sailors of the
Navy, two servants, an interpreter, and two companions. The orchestra
consisted of four brass gongs of varying sizes, and a tom-tom. Torches
were stuck in the ground to illuminate the scene, and the whole of the
inhabitants of the hamlet turned out and watched the proceedings with
greatest interest. The dances were performed by men, women, and
children, one at a time, and were perfectly modest and graceful. The
women were dressed in shirts and bright-coloured <i>patadions</i>, and
were adorned with silver rings, brass bangles, and armlets, some had
strings of beads round their necks. The best dance was performed by a
young woman, holding in each hand a piece of a branch of the
bread-fruit tree, which they call <i>Rima</i>, with two of the large
handsome leaves. These she waved about very gracefully in harmony with
her movements. The spectators behaved very well, and were careful not
to crowd round me. I rewarded the dancers with beads and handkerchiefs,
and the musicians with cigars. This dancing seemed to me a very
innocent amusement, but I was sorry to find that the missionary
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>took a different view. He associated the dances
with heathen rites and forbade them, confiscating the dearly-bought
gongs of his converts, as he said they were used to call up evil
spirits. However, I observed that he had hung up the largest gong to
serve as a church-bell, after having sprinkled it with holy water. I
remembered having read how the Moravian missionaries in Greenland put a
stop to the dancing which formerly enlivened the long dark winter of
that desolate region, and I asked myself why the Christian missionary,
whether teaching in the icy gloom of the Arctic circle, or in brilliant
sunshine on a palm-fringed strand, must forbid his converts to indulge
in such a healthful and harmless recreation, in both cases almost the
sole possible amusement. I could see no reason why the heathen should
have all the fun. The labours of the missionary were, however, very
much to the benefit of the Tagban&uacute;as, as inducing them to settle
down, build houses, and raise crops for their support.</p>
<p>The Spanish gun-boats had stopped the inroads of Moros by sea, and
detachments of native troops along the coast stopped the raiding by
land. For twenty years the Tagban&uacute;as had suffered little, and
for several years absolutely nothing from the Moros, yet they
apparently could not realise their security, and were afraid to
accumulate anything lest it should be taken from them. To the ravages
of the pirate, there has succeeded the extortion of the usurer, and
John Chinaman waxes fat whilst the wretched Tagban&uacute;a
starves.</p>
<p>Whilst travelling through the jungle I found some natives cutting
canes, and my interpreter pointed out to me an emaciated couple, and
assured me that during the famine of the previous season, these poor
wretches had killed and eaten their own child to save their lives. What
a state of things in a country where maize will grow up and give edible
grain in forty-two days from the date of planting it! I trust that the
change of government may result in some benefit to these poor people,
and that a Governor or Protector of Aborigines may be appointed with
absolute power who will check the abuses of the half-caste and Chinese
usurers, and give the poor down-trodden Tagban&uacute;as, at one time I
firmly believe a comparatively civilised people, a chance to live and
thrive. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=

<h3 class="main">Tandulanos.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Tandulanos are physically similar to the Negritos,
but less robust. They inhabit the shores of Palawan, being scattered
along the western coast between the Bay of Malampaya and Caruray. They
are more savage than the other races of the island, but they fulfil
their engagements with rigorous exactness. They make rough canoes, and
subsist principally on fish and shell-fish, and they do no cultivation.
They are very skilful in the use of the harpoon which they employ for
fishing. If they can obtain iron, they use it for their harpoon-points,
otherwise they point them with the spike from the tail of a skate.</p>
<p>They use a most active poison on their harpoons and darts, so much
so, that it is said to produce almost instantaneous death.</p>
<p>This poison is unknown to the other tribes. They refuse to sell
their <i>cerbatanas</i>, or blow-pipes, from which they shoot their
darts.</p>
<p>They are said to intermarry indiscriminately, without regard to
kinship. Their number was computed at 1500 in the year 1888, and they
are probably not much more numerous now.</p>
<p>These people are, like the Negritos, whom they resemble, a hopeless
race, not capable of advancing in civilisation.</p>

<h3 class="main">Manguianes and Negritos of Palawan.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These people have been described under the heading
Aetas or Negritos, in Part I. The first-named inhabit the interior of
that part of the island occupied by the Moros who jealously prevent
them from holding any intercourse with strangers.</p>
<p><i>Moros of Southern Palawan.</i>&mdash;These people do not differ
in any essential particular from the Moros of Mindanao. They look back
with regret on the good old days before the advent of the steam
gun-boats, and the establishment of the fortified posts along their
shores when they could make their annual raids and massacre, plunder,
and enslave, the wretched Tagban&uacute;as without interference. They
will doubtless take full advantage of any negligence of the United
States authorities to keep up the gun-boat flotilla, and to maintain
the military posts. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318"
name="pb318">318</a>]</span></p>
<p>They now live by agriculture, all the labour being performed by
slaves, and by trading with the savages of the mountains, vying with
the Christians in usurious rapacity.</p>
<p><i>John Chinaman</i> in Palawan is just the same as his brother in
Mindanao&mdash;a remorseless usurer, and a skilful manipulator of false
weights and measures, but no worse in the treatment of the unhappy
aboriginal than the Christian native or half-caste.</p>
<p><i>Puerto Princesa</i>, the capital, had a population at the time of
my visit in 1890 of about 1500, of which number 1200 were males and 300
females. About half the males were soldiers and sailors, one-fourth
convicts, and the remainder civilians. Most of the women had been
deported from Manila as undesirable characters in that decorous city.
Notwithstanding their unsavoury antecedents, they found new husbands or
protectors in Puerto Princesa the moment they landed. Such was the
competition for these very soiled doves, that most of them had made
their new arrangements before leaving the jetty alongside which the
steamer they arrived in lay.</p>
<p>There was some little cultivation round about the capital, but as
usual trading with the aborigines for gum, rattans, balate, green
snail-shells, and other jungle produce was the most entrancing
pursuit.</p>
<p>At a short distance from the town was a Government Sugar Plantation,
which I visited. If sugar planting could flourish anywhere, it surely
should have done so here, for the land cost nothing, the convicts did
all the unskilled labour and the machinery was paid for by the
Government. Yet the blighting influence of the official mind succeeded
even here in causing the place to be run at a loss. The sugar badly
prepared was shipped to Manila to be sold at a reduced price, and sugar
for the troops and general use was imported from other parts.</p>
<p>The governor of the island, during the later period of Spanish rule,
has usually been a naval officer, and as the communications are
principally by sea, and any punitive operations have to be performed by
the gun-boat flotilla, this would seem to be a precedent the United
States might follow with advantage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>1. The consonants in the Tagban&uacute;a alphabet are eleven and
sometimes twelve, but the vowels are three, since the <i>ia</i> and the

they may be considered as vowels, but the <i>ia</i> and the <i>ua</i>
are written the same, as has been said. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>2. In reading the Tagban&uacute;a alphabet, you begin from the
bottom upwards.</p>
<p>3. To write the consonants with their vowels, for example,
<i>ba</i>, <i>be</i>, <i>bi</i>, <i>bo</i>, <i>bu</i>, you put a dash
at the right or left. If on the right, it means <i>be</i>, <i>bi</i>,

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mindanao is of a very irregular shape, which it is not
easy to describe. It has some resemblance to a winged skate, with a
long tail, one of the <i>Raiid&aelig;</i>, which is common in Manila
Bay. The head of the skate is turned to the east; the peninsula of
Surigao forms the northern wing, and Punta Panguian the tip of the
southern wing, out of which, however, a great piece has been bitten,
corresponding to the Gulf of Davao. The body is represented by the main
part of the island, and the tail commences at the isthmus of
Tuc&uacute;ran and stretches westward for a degree of longitude. This
straight part is the old kingdom of Sibuguey. On the north of it,
however, a huge excrescence appears; this is the peninsula of Dapitan,
and on the south, opposite to it, there is a similar projection, which
is cut in two by the Gulf of Dumanquilas.</p>
<p>Mt. Silingan represents the spike or hook usually found on the tails
of these fish, and from here the tail bends southward and westward
through an arc of 60&deg;. This part represents the peninsula of
Zamboanga, and the town of that name is situated at the tip of the
tail. A continuous chain of mountains down the centre of the tail
represents the vertebr&aelig;.</p>
<p>Beginning on the east, we find a long stretch of coast from Surigao
to Cape San Agustin with only one or two <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb322" href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>anchorages for small
vessels. The rest of the coast is exposed to the full force of the
Pacific Ocean, and from November to April is quite open to the N.E.
monsoon. It is also subject to tidal waves or rollers just as are the
coasts of Peru and Chili. A destructive <i>bore</i> enters the river
mouths and inlets, and heavy seas get up off all the headlands. In the
channels between Surigao and the islands off the northern coasts, rapid
currents are formed and overfalls render navigation dangerous for
country vessels. In fact, during the strength of the N.E. monsoon the
east coast, from Placer to the Bay of Mayo, is hemmed in with surf, and
without a single port. Behind point Taucanan, however, is found Port
Balete and Port Pujada. This latter is the best port in the island,
being well sheltered from the N. and N.E. The country about it is well
watered, and produces timber trees of great size and fine quality. The
waters contain plenty of fish, and turtle, also some mother-of-pearl
shells. The forests give the best kinds of <i>alm&aacute;ciga</i>, and
wax.</p>
<p>The hill-men are partly independent but pacific, and the Visaya
population is considerable in the district of Mati.</p>
<p>In general, the east coast is rocky, and very foul in many places.
The land is fertile and well-wooded. Gold is found in the Cordillera,
and on its eastern slopes all the way from Surigao to Punta Tagobong.
One of the northern towns is called Placer on this account. The
inaccessibility of the east coast during the strength of the N.E.
monsoon has retarded the civilisation of Surigao which was settled in
the early years of the conquest. The Caraga-Visaya, who inhabit a
considerable district on this coast, are old Christians and have always
been ready to fight for their faith.</p>
<p>Practically parallel to this coast is a chain of mountains which
begins at Surigao and extends down to Punta San Agustin with hardly a
break. I shall call this the eastern Cordillera. In this chain, near
the northern end, lies Lake Mainit (Hot Lake), having steep sides with
twenty fathoms close to the edge, and two hundred fathoms in the
middle. This cavity has, no doubt, been formed by volcanic action, like
the lake of Taal. On the slopes of the mountains around it are many
thermal springs which run into the lake, and in rainy weather the
summits are always shrouded in vapour by the evaporation of the rain.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>The lake is subject to tremendous floods. Dr. Montano, who visited
it in December, 1880, speaks of a rise of twelve fathoms. He also says
that a ground-swell gets up in this sheltered lake; this must be from
some modified volcanic action still going on. As usual in Philippine
crater-lakes, this is a great breeding-place for alligators.</p>
<p>The Eastern Cordillera being so near the coast, there are of course
no navigable rivers running into the Pacific, but the streams become
impassable torrents during the heavy rains which begin in June, and
prevent communication by land for many days or even weeks at a
stretch.</p>
<p>Approximately parallel to the Eastern Cordillera, and at about fifty
geographical miles distance, there stands another range which I shall
call the Central Cordillera. A line drawn from Punta Diuata to the
middle of the Gulf of Sarangani, nearly due north and south, intersects
Mt. Sinalagao, Mt. Panamoyan, the active volcano, Mt. Apo and Mt.
Matutuan, which appear to be the loftiest peaks of the range.</p>
<p>From Mt. Panamoyan in about 7&deg; 50&prime; N. Lat. a spur strikes
eastwards at right angles to the range, reaching half-way across the
valley. This spur then turns to the south parallel to the range for
some twenty miles, and from the middle of the east and west part,
another spur turns south for about 20 miles, thus forming a letter
<span class="xd20e7860">E</span> with the points looking south.</p>
<p>In the wide valley between the Eastern and Central Cordilleras, and
taking the drainage of the whole watershed is the River Agusan. Rising
about the 7th parallel on the slopes of Mt. Tagoppo, this river runs a
very sinuous course in a general northerly direction, but inclining
slightly to the west, receiving innumerable tributaries on either side.
At about 8&deg; 15&prime; N. Lat. the Agusan expands or overflows,
forming a series of shallow lakes, choked up with driftwood and
vegetation, and varying in extent with the rainfall.</p>
<p>Continually gathering volume, it runs into the Bay of Butuan about
9&deg; N. Lat.</p>
<p>At Moncayo, in 7&deg; 45&prime; N. Lat., the Agusan is one hundred
yards wide, and is navigable for canoes even much higher up.</p>
<p>The spur previously spoken of as striking east and south from Mt.
Panamoyan, forms two small watersheds. The western one gives rise to
the River Libaganon, and the eastern to the River Salug. Both these
rivers run in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324"
name="pb324">324</a>]</span>southerly direction, and unite to form the
River Tagum, which runs for a short distance S.E. and falls into the
head of the Gulf of Davao.</p>
<p>A little way south of Mt. Panamoyan some mountain streams dash down
the sides of the Cordillera and running through a gap unite to form the
River Davao which flows in a south-easterly direction till it reaches
the plain, when it changes its course and runs east into the Gulf of
Davao. From Point Sipaca, in 9&deg; N. Lat., a range of mountains
stretches in a southerly direction for about sixty miles. <span class=
"corr" id="xd20e11282" title="Source: Amongt">Amongst</span> these are
Mt. Sipaca, Mt. Saorag, and Mt. Quimanquil. With the Central Cordillera
this range forms a watershed, and the torrents on the steep sides of
Sinalagao and Quimanquil dash down and take a southerly direction to
form the headwaters of the River Pulangui and ultimately become the Rio
Grande. In 7&deg; 50&prime; N. Lat. two important affluents join, the
River Sauaga and the River Malupati, a few miles lower the Calibatojan
and the Kaya-Kaya bring their tribute, and the united flood with rapid
current casts itself headlong into the deep Ca&ntilde;on of Locosocan
and runs in this for over four miles to Salagalpon, where another
cataract occurs. The river continues for miles a rushing torrent
amongst huge boulders, at the bottom of this cleft, so narrow in
places, where the rocks jut out and nearly meet overhead, that it seems
like a tunnel. In 7&deg; 46&prime; N. Lat. there is a small volcano
close to the left bank which, whenever it rains, becomes active and
gives off stifling fumes of sulphur. At Mantanil, in 7&deg; 40&prime;
N., the river can be navigated on bamboo rafts, handled by skilled
Manobo pilots, but not without much risk; for some distance down there
are two <i>buchis</i>, or sinks, where the water runs down into
subterraneous passages through the river-bed, forming dangerous
whirlpools. There are also several rapids which require great dexterity
to pass safely. The banks are still high; but, on approaching the
confluence of the Kulaman river, on the left bank, the gorge is much
lower, and on arriving at Ilang the country opens out.</p>
<p>South of the confluence of the River Molita, vintas can navigate the
river, and a little lower down, at the confluence of the River Simuni,
is the place reached by the gunboat <i>Taal</i> in 1863 on a 6-foot
draught. The river now runs in a southerly and westerly direction, with
dozens of bends till about 6&deg; 45&prime; N. Lat., when, on reaching
Lake Liguasan (really a Pinag) a shallow and weedy expanse of water, it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>turns to the west, and then north-west. At
Tumbao it bifurcates, and enters the Bay of Illana by two mouths
forming a long narrow delta of deep and rich alluvial soil.</p>
<p>From Tumbao to Tamontaca is the most beautiful and fertile part of
this river. On both banks grow cocoa-palms, areca-palms, banana and
cacao-trees, coffee-bushes, and hemp plants in abundance, and amongst
them are groups of native houses forming a continuous village, of which
the placid river, here fifty yards wide, forms the main street. These
houses are mostly occupied by friendly Moros.</p>
<p>Nearly parallel to the Sipaca-Soarag-Quimanquil range a second range
stretches irregularly in a north and south line, ending at the coast
near Cagayan. Amongst these mountains is Mt Quitanglag. From Pt.
Sulanan the western extremity of the Bay of Macajalar, a third range
stretches south, then south-east, then south again for some thirty
miles. Between this range and the Bay of Iligan there is a fourth range
of hills. These four ranges form three valleys or watersheds, each of
which has its river, with a general course from south to north, all
three running into the Bay of Macajalar.</p>
<p>The most easterly is the River of Tagoloan which has fourteen
tributaries, the next is the River Cagayan with only three, then the
River Capay with seven tributaries, all on the left bank.</p>
<p>Proceeding westward we come to the great and deep Lake of Lanao,
described under the heading Moros, but which has never been surveyed,
and then to the Gulf of Panguil, which, on the map, looks like a
forearm and clenched fist, which nearly cuts Mindanao in two. The
isthmus is only fourteen miles across in a straight line.</p>
<p>This was formerly a regular pirates&rsquo; track, over which they
hauled their vessels, but it was till lately guarded by a chain of
forts connected by a military road called the Trocha of Tucuran.</p>
<p>Two rivers running in a general direction from west to east and
having between them a dozen tributaries, run into the Gulf of Panguil.
The most northerly of the two is the Mipangi and the other is the
Lintogo.</p>
<p>We now arrive at the peninsula of Sibuguey which I have likened to
the tail of the skate. Around Lake Lanao there is an irregular loop of
hills, and from the western end of this starts a cordillera which
stretches right down the centre of the peninsula of Sibuguey and
Zamboanga. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>line drawn from Punta Sicayati (in the Dapitan
excrescence) to the eastern shore of the Gulf of Dumanquilas will
intersect a range of mountains which cross the Cordillera of Sibuguey
nearly at right angles and with equal arms north and south. But the end
of the northern arm bifurcates and throws out two ranges N.E. and
N.W.</p>
<p>In the watershed thus formed three rivers take their rise, and have
a general course from south to north but bearing a little to the
westward. The easternmost of these is called the Dapitan, and runs into
the bay of the same name. The next is the Dipolog, which runs into the
sea west of Punta Sicayab; and the last is the Lubungan, running in
about two leagues more to the west.</p>
<p>The other rivers in the peninsula are so unimportant that I do not
enumerate them. Like those on the east coast they become raging
torrents in the rainy season.</p>
<p>On the northern and southern coasts, which are more protected than
the eastern, sheltered anchorages are to be found here and there, but
no such fine natural harbours exist as abound in Southern Luzon. There
is, however, less need for them, as it is very rare that the typhoons,
which are so destructive in Luzon and the Visayas, cause damage in
Mindanao, except at its northern and eastern corner. But for service on
these coasts, vessels of a light draught of water are the most useful,
as they can more easily find sheltered anchorage.</p>
<p>Mindanao is not nearly so unhealthy as is commonly supposed.
Zamboanga and neighbourhood, Davao, Surigao, Talisay, and several other
places, are really quite healthy for Europeans, if they take care of
themselves.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are frequent. They would sometimes be destructive, but
there is so little in the way of buildings to destroy. <i>Divisions for
Administrative Purposes.</i></p>
<p>Zamboanga is the chief military station and the residence of the
commandant-general of the island.</p>
<p>Mindanao is divided into five districts:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1st. District chief town Zamboanga (capital of the island).</li>
<li>2nd. District chief town Misamis (includes Lake Lanao).</li>
<li>3rd. District chief town Surigao (includes the whole kingdom of
Caraga, also the valley of the Agusan).<span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span></li>
<li>4th. District chief town Davao (shores of the bay and peninsula of
San Agustin).</li>
<li>5th. District chief town Cotta-bato (valley of the Rio Grande and
ancient Sultanate of Buhayen).</li>
</ul>
<p>The island of Basilan forms a sixth district under the
commandant-general of Mindanao.</p>
<p>Each of these districts was under a politico-military governor and
other officials, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>1st District, Major, Naval Lieutenant, Captain of Port.</li>
<li>2nd District, Lieut.-Colonel.</li>
<li>3rd District, Lieut.-Colonel.</li>
<li>4th District, Major.</li>
<li>5th District, Lieut.-Colonel.</li>
<li>6th District, Naval Lieutenant, Naval Station.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these politico-military governors there were the following
officers in charge of military districts:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mumungan in 2nd district (Fort Weyler and vicinity to look after
the Moros of Lake Lanao) Major.</li>
<li>Dapitan in 2nd district (To look after the Moros of Sindangan Bay)
Major.</li>
<li>Bislig in 3rd district (To look after the Mandayas and Manobos)
Captain.</li>
</ul>
<p>To attend to the administration of justice there was a third-class
judge in each district. From their decisions there was an appeal to the
Audiencia at Ceb&uacute;, and from there to the Supreme Court,
Madrid.</p>
<p>In Zamboanga where there is (or was) a custom-house, there resided a
Treasury delegate of the second class. In each of the other districts
there is one of the fourth class.</p>
<p>The southern naval division has its headquarters at Isabela de
Basilan.</p>

<h3 class="main">Productions of Mindanao.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The climate and soil of Mindanao are suitable for
growing almost any tropical crop to great advantage: hemp, sugar cane,
tobacco, coffee, cacao, rice, indigo, sesame, maize, sweet potatoes,
pepper, all flourish. But the island is very backward; it is only
recently that the savage races have been settled in the <i lang=
"es">reducciones</i>. The population is very sparse, and natives are
more addicted to washing the sands for gold or seeking jungle-produce
than disposed to apply themselves to agriculture. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span></p>
<p>The exports have hitherto been very small. About some of the
northern ports a good beginning has been made in cultivating and
preparing hemp, and several Spaniards have laid out plantations
there.</p>
<p>There is a small export of coffee and cacao, and the circumstance
that the greater part of the island is free from typhoons renders it
exceptionally favourable for planting these valuable products, or for
growing unlimited quantities of cocoa-nut for making copra. For the
same reason the timber in Mindanao is larger than in the best districts
of Luzon, and some of the trees are truly magnificent. Mindanao, with
its inhabitants busily engaged in murdering their neighbours and
enslaving their children, can, of course, never prosper; but if such
outrages are repressed, and peace assured, the population will rapidly
increase and agriculture will prosper.</p>
<p>Amongst the forest produce gutta-percha took a leading place, but
this product came through the hands of the Chinese traders, who, as
their custom is, adulterated it to such an extent that its value became
greatly depreciated in European and American markets, and the trade
fell off. Some lignite is found in Mindanao, but I have no confidence
in the value of Philippine coal-fields. They have been too much broken
up by volcanic action. I have very little doubt that petroleum will be
found in Mindanao when it is explored. It has been reported in Mindoro
and Ceb&uacute;.</p>
<p>The early explorers of the Archipelago state that the natives wore
little clothes, but abundance of gold ornaments. Now they wear more
clothes but little gold. It is surprising how quickly the heathen
become impoverished whenever they have Christian neighbours.</p>

<h3 class="main">Basilan.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sixth district of Mindanao is formed of the
Basilan group of some forty islands lying opposite to Zamboanga, having
a total area of 170,000 acres. The only important one of the group is
Basilan Island, which has an irregular outline, an oval with two
projections opposite each other, east and west, the latter resembles a
turtle&rsquo;s head and the former a turtle&rsquo;s tail, so that the
shape of the island on the map is that of a turtle with his head to the
west. The total length from the point of the beak to the tip of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>tail is about thirty-two geographical miles, and
the width across the body about twenty-one miles. The port of Isabela
is sheltered by the Island of Malamaui, on which there is a Moro
rancheria called Lucbalan, and a Christian visita, Sta. Barbara. The
capital, Isabela, is situated about the centre of the channel, and to
the east of the mouth of the Pasahan (now called Isabela) River.</p>
<p>To the south of the town, which is situated on a stony slope at a
short distance, the fort is placed at an elevation of about sixty feet
above the sea. It commands both entrances of the channel.</p>
<p>There is a barrack near the fort, a prison, military infirmary,
school, town hall. The naval station consists of store-houses and
workshops, marine-barracks, hospital, and magazine.</p>
<p>There is a church, and missionaries&rsquo; residence. The island is
hilly but fertile in places. Some twenty to thirty acres are under
cultivation near Isabela, and the Moros who form the principal
population make their slaves work on the lands about their hamlets.
There are no manufactures worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The Christian population is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Moro population is distributed in about fifty villages or
hamlets. They can turn out about 4400 fighting-men, and are considered
valiant and hardy.</p>
<p>The Moros of Basilan, according to Father Foradada, have not the
sanguinary instincts of those of Lake Lanao or of Jol&oacute;, and any
outrages they commit are, he thinks, due to the instigations of the
Moros of Jol&oacute;, who unfortunately keep up a communication with
them and corrupt them.</p>
<p>Amongst the most influential Dattos of Basilan is Pedro Cuevas, a
Tagal. He was formerly a convict, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>escaped, and, by
force of character and desperate courage, he became a leading man
amongst the Moros. Having rendered some services to Spain, he received
a pardon, and now has extensive plantations, a sugar-mill, and herds of
cattle. He is, in fact, about the richest and most influential man in
the island, and has become reconciled to the Church, and was much
trusted both by the military and naval authorities and by the
missionaries.</p>
<p>The map of the island is from a report of Father Cavalleria who went
by sea right round it in 1893. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331"

<h3 class="main">Visayas (1) [Old Christians].</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In another part of the book I have given a description
of the Visayas in their own islands, and have spoken of their
enterprise and industry as manifested in the extent of their exports of
sugar and hemp, and in their manufacture of textiles of the most varied
kind.</p>
<p>The Visayas of Mindanao have been modified by their environment both
for good and evil. Thus they are bolder and more warlike than their
brethren at home, having had for centuries to defend themselves against
bloodthirsty Moros. The Visayas of Caraga are especially valiant and
self-reliant, and they needed to be so, for the Spaniards, whenever
hard pressed by English, Dutch or Portuguese, had a way of recalling
their garrisons, and leaving their dependents to shift for themselves.
The Visaya of Mindanao, therefore, though not a soldier, is a
fighting-man, and their towns possess a rudimentary defensive
organisation called the <i>somaten</i>. This, I believe is a Catalan
word, and indicates a body of armed townsmen called together by the
church bell to defend the place against attack. This service is
compulsory and unpaid.</p>
<p>The arms have been supplied by the Spanish Government, and have
generally been of obsolete pattern. I have seen in Culion flint-lock
muskets in the hands of the guards. Latterly, however, Remington rifles
have been supplied, and they are very serviceable and quite suitable
for these levies.</p>
<p>The Visayas have been the assistants of the missionaries, and from
them come most of the school-masters <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb332" href="#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>and mistresses who
instruct the children of the recently-converted natives.</p>
<p>Their language is fast extending, and their numbers are increasing,
both naturally, and by a considerable voluntary immigration from the
southern Visayas Islands.</p>
<p>To the inhabitants of these small islands, fertile Mindanao, with
its broad lands, free to all, is what the United States were a
generation ago to the cotters of Cork or Kerry&mdash;a land of
promise.</p>
<p>There is, however, a demoralising tendency at work amongst the
Visayas. The profits of bartering with the hill-men are so great, that
they are tempted away from their agriculture, and from their looms, to
take up this lucrative trade, in competition with the Chinese.</p>
<p>The Visaya has one great advantage over the Chinaman; he has the
courage to go up into the hills, and find his <span class="corr" id=
"xd20e11527" title="Source: cutomers">customers</span> in their haunts.
This the Celestial could not do, but has to remain at his store on the
coast and await the hill-men.</p>
<p>Both traders cheat the hill-tribes most abominably.</p>
<p>Dr. Montano mentions a case which happened in Butuan in December,
1879.</p>
<p>A Visaya went into the interior taking with him some threads of
different colours which he had purchased for seventy-five cents, and
returned with jungle produce worth ten dollars. This he invested in
beads, brass-wire, and other articles of trade, and returned to the
woods. In a month he came back, bringing produce to the value of 100
dollars, and 400 dollars to his credit with the natives.</p>
<p>The tribes of Mindanao pay their debts with scrupulous exactness. If
they die before paying, their sons assume the debt, and unless they are
killed or taken as slaves by other races, the money is sure to be paid.
Consequently, this rapacious usurer had sold them goods costing 10
dollars, 75 cents, for 510 dollars, of which 110 dollars in cash, and
400 dollars credit. It is satisfactory to learn that the commandant at
Butuan made him disgorge, and freed the hill-men from their heavy
debt.</p>

<p>To sum up, the Visaya is a necessary man in Mindanao, and the
immigration should be encouraged. All the Visaya towns bordering on the
Moros should have their <i>somatenes</i> armed, exercised, and supplied
with ammunition. Amongst Visayas are to be found plenty of men well
suited to command these bands. As they are fighting the Moros for life
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=

them manfully.</p>

town of Baganga, in Caraga, under a native officer of gigantic stature,
Lieutenant Don Prudencio Garcia.</p>

<h3 class="main">Maman&uacute;as (2).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A hybrid race between Negritos and Malays.</p>
<p>They are not numerous, and live in the northern promontory of
Surigao, from near the River Agusan to the east coast, south of Lake
Mainit. They are, indeed, miserable wretches, wandering in the hills
and forest without any fixed habitation, their only property a lance, a
bolo, and some starveling curs.</p>
<p>Sometimes they plant a few sweet potatoes, and at certain times in
the year they get wild honey; at other times they hunt the wild pig.
They lay up no provisions, and wander about naked and hungry. They are
difficult to convert, having no good qualities to work upon. They
promise anything, but never perform, being able to give as a
reason&mdash;some evil omen, for instance&mdash;that, on coming out in
the morning, they have heard the cry of the turtle-dove
(<i>limbucun</i>) on the left hand.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all these difficulties, the zeal of the missionaries
has not been wasted, and several reducciones of Maman&uacute;as have
been founded, and are progressing to some extent.</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Manobos (3).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Manobos are a warlike heathen race, widely
extended in Mindanao. The great River Agusan, taking its rise in the
district of Davao, in 7&deg; N. latitude, falls into the Bay of Butuan
about 9&deg; N. latitude. Its general course is parallel to the eastern
Cordillera, from which it receives numerous tributaries. At almost
8&deg; 15&prime; N. latitude it expands, and forms four considerable
lakes of no great depth, and varying in extent according to the season.
They are partly covered by aquatic plants. These lakes are called
Linao, Dagun, Dinagat and Cadocun; they are quite near each other. The
Manobos inhabit this spacious valley from Moncado, in 7&deg; 45&prime;,
to about 8&deg; 45&prime; N. latitude on the right bank, where they
come in contact with the Maman&uacute;as and Mandayas; but on the left
bank they extend nearly to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href=
"#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>the sea, and up to the eastern
slopes of the Central Cordillera. They even extend over the Cordillera
to the head waters of the Rio Grande<span class="corr" id="xd20e11578"
title="Source: ,">.</span> They occupy the left bank of the Pulangui,
and their southern frontier on the Rio Grande is at 7&deg; 30&prime; N.
latitude, where one of their chiefs, called the Datto Capitan Manobo,
lives. The river is navigable for <i>vintas</i> up to here, and, in
1863, the gunboat <i>Taal</i>, drawing six feet, steamed to within five
miles of this point, say up to the River Simuni. They extend up the
Pulangui to about 8&deg; 15&prime; N. latitude. In appearance they have
a Mongolian cast of feature. Their faces are longer than amongst the
Mandayas; their noses are not flattened, but straight, and projecting,
and slightly curved at the lower end. Their general aspect is robust;
their stature is about 5 feet 7 inches. Their usual dress consists of
short drawers reaching to the knee, and a sort of singlet, or short
shirt.</p>
<p>They live in clans under a <i>bagani</i>, or head-murderer (see
<i>Mandayas</i> for explanation), who is usually accompanied by his
brothers-in-law. They are polygamists; still, the first wife is the
head, and all the others must obey her. Each wife has her own house,
just as the late Brigham Young&rsquo;s harem had at Salt Lake City. But
they are satisfied with fewer than that prophet, there being none
amongst their dattos who have nineteen wives. They are slaveholders, as
the children taken in war become slaves, and all the work of
cultivation is done by the women, children and slaves.</p>
<p>Their houses are built on piles, as are also their granaries. They
cultivate on a considerable scale, and raise quantities of rice, maize,
sweet potatoes and tobacco, not only to supply their own wants, but to
sell in boat-loads to the Visayas. Their arms are lances, shields,
swords and daggers, and, in some parts, bows and arrows. They are said
to be expert archers where they use the bow. They raise numbers of
horses for riding.</p>
<p>In valour, and in disposition to come to close quarters in fighting,
they resemble the Igorrotes of Luzon. They stand up squarely to the
Moros, which few other races have the pluck to do. Like the Igorrotes,
their religion consists in ancestor-worship, but they call their idols
Dinatas instead of Anitos. They are much impressed by thunder, which
they call the voice of the lightning, and a rainbow fills them with
awe. Like the Tagals, and some races in British India, they consider
the crocodile a sacred animal, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335"
href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>respectfully address it as
grandfather. They also, like the old heathen Tagals, consider rocks,
caves, or balete trees, as residences of spirits. They celebrate a
feast in honour of the Dinatas after the harvest, and make sacrifices
of swine.</p>
<p>Tag-Busan is their god of war, and it is usual amongst them to go on
the war-path after the harvest is secured; the <i>bagani</i>, as high
priest of this god, carries his talisman hung round his neck.</p>
<p>They make ambuscades, and attack neighbours or enemies in the most
treacherous manner, either by setting fire to their houses and
murdering them as they attempt to escape from the flames, or they cut
through the piles supporting the houses, covering themselves with their
shields interlocked whilst doing so, and spearing the occupants when
the house falls. When an enemy has been felled, the bagani, taking a
consecrated sword, never used in fighting, cuts open the chest, and
immerses the talisman of the god in the blood; then, tearing out the
heart or liver, he eats a piece. The S&aacute;copes are not allowed
this privilege, which belongs only to the chief, as the high priest of
the god of war. The children of the slain are taken as slaves, and the
young women for concubines. One of the prisoners is kept to be
sacrificed in some cruel manner to Tag-Busan on the return of the
expedition as a thank-offering.</p>
<p>The death of a relative requires to be atoned for by the murder of
any innocent person passing by, the avenger concealing himself near a
path, and killing the first stranger who comes.</p>
<p>The Manobos are very smart in handling canoes or rafts on their
rivers, which are very dangerous to navigate, and have many rapids and
whirlpools; the Pulangui even precipitates itself into a chasm, and
runs underground for a league and a half. However, the terrible picture
I have drawn of their habits is becoming year by year a thing of the
past to thousands of Manobos, although still kept up in places. The
intrepidity of the Jesuit missionaries is proof against every danger
and every privation, has carried them up the River Agusan, on which, at
short distances apart, they have established towns or villages, and
have brought many thousands of Manobos within the Christian
communion.</p>
<p>Father Urios, one of these missionaries, baptized 5200 <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>heathen in one year, and now no less than twenty
Christian towns or villages stand on the banks of the River Agusan and
its tributaries, populated by perhaps fifteen thousand Manobos,
formerly heathens, who have given up their detestable practices and
their murderous slave-raids to occupy themselves in cultivating the
soil, whilst their children of both sexes are receiving instruction
from Visaya school-masters and mistresses. There is always a tendency
to <i lang="es">remontar</i> amongst them, and sometimes nearly all the
inhabitants of a village take to the woods and hills. Yet, secure from
attack, the number of converts steadily increases. The Baganis have
become <i lang="es">gobernadorcillos</i>, and their chief vassals
<i lang="es">tenientes, jueces de paz,</i> and <i lang=
"es">cuadrilleros</i>. Some of the old Baganis who were well off were
so anxious not to be behind the Visayas, that they sent to Manila for
hats, black cloth coats and trousers, and patent leather shoes, to wear
on the great feasts of the Church, and on the occasion of the annual
village festival.</p>
<p>This is a long way from human sacrifices to the Tag-Busan, and
ceremonial cannibal rites, which these men formerly practised. I look
on this warlike and vigorous race as capable of becoming valuable
citizens, but they will require careful handling for some years to
come. They must not be rushed, for, if alarmed by innovations, they may
take to the woods <i>en masse</i>, and the labour of years will have
been wasted.</p>
<p>I look to this tribe, when trained to use fire-arms, and stiffened
with a few Americans, to destroy the power of the pirate
races&mdash;the murderous, slave-hunting Moros, with whom it is useless
to make treaties, who cannot be converted till the power of their
dattos is broken, and who must be sternly put down by force unless the
nascent civilisation of Mindanao is to be thrown back for a
century.</p>
<p>In the beginning of June, 1892, a Bagani of the Manobos performed
the <i>paghuaga</i>, or human sacrifice, on a hill opposite Veruela, on
the River Agusan. The victim was a Christian girl whom he had bought
for the purpose from some slave-raiders.</p>

<h3 class="main">Mandayas (4).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mandayas live on the Eastern Cordillera of
Mindanao which runs parallel to the coast, and their territory extends
from the 7th to the 9th parallel. They occupy the country <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>down
to the River Salug. They are remarkable for their light colour, some
having quite fair complexions. Their faces are wide, the cheek-bones
being very prominent; yet their appearance is not unpleasing, for they
have large dark eyes shaded by long eye-lashes.</p>
<p>They are much respected by other tribes as an ancient and
aristocratic race, and the war-like Manobos eagerly seek, by fair means
or foul, to obtain Mandaya women for wives.</p>
<p>They usually shave off their beards, and also their eyebrows,
wearing their hair long, tied in a knot at the back.</p>
<p>They are powerfully built, and of good stature. The men wear short
drawers, and on grand occasions don an embroidered jacket. Both men and
women wear large ear-ornaments. The women are clad in a bodice and
patadion with ornaments of shells, beads, or small bells. The men are
of a bold and warlike disposition, ready to fight against other
villages of their tribe when not at war with the Manobos, the Guiangas,
or the Manguangas, their neighbours. They have a language of their own
which has a great affinity to the Visaya.</p>
<p>Their houses, four or five forming a village, are built on lofty
piles thirty or forty, or even fifty feet above the ground. The floor
is of thick planks and has a parapet all round pierced with loop-holes
for defence. Above this parapet the house is open all round up to the
eaves, but this space can be closed in by hanging shutters in bad
weather. The construction of dwellings at such a height must involve an
enormous amount of labour. Each group of houses forming a village is
usually surrounded by a strong palisade of sharp-pointed posts, and
further defended by pits lined with sharp stakes, which are lightly
covered over with twigs and leaves.</p>
<p>Several families live in one house, after the custom of the Dayaks
of Borneo, to provide a garrison for defence. An ample supply of arms
is kept in the house, bows and arrows, spears, swords and knives. They
are liable to be attacked in the night, either by the Manobos, the
Moros, or by the <i>s&aacute;copes</i> of some neighbouring datto, who
shoot flaming arrows covered with resin into the roof to set it on
fire, or covering themselves with their shields from the arrows of the
defenders, make a determined attempt to cut down the piles so that the
house will fall. The attacking party is most often victorious, and the
defenders, driven out by fire, or bruised and entangled amongst the
fallen timbers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338"
name="pb338">338</a>]</span>are easily killed, the women and children,
with the other booty, being carried off by the assailants. Under this
reign of terror the population is diminishing. These people not only
kill for booty, but also for the honour and glory of it. Each warrior
is anxious to become a <i>bagani</i>, and to be allowed to wear the
honourable insignia of that rank. The dress of a <i>bagani</i>
indicates approximately the number of murders he has committed. A
scarlet head-cloth shows that he has killed from five to ten men; a red
shirt, in addition, from ten to twenty, whilst a complete suit of red
shows that he has murdered more than twenty persons, and is a
much-desired and very honourable distinction, a sort of D.S.O. or
K.C.B. amongst them.</p>
<p>All the dattos are <i>baganis</i>; they could hardly possess enough
prestige to govern their s&aacute;copes without this title.</p>
<p>The Mandayas are superstitious, and much attached to their own
beliefs, and on this account it is difficult to convert them to
Christianity. The devotion of the Jesuits, however, has not been in
vain, and several pueblos on the east coast round about Bislig, Caraga,
and Cateel-Baganga are now inhabited by Christian Mandayas, some of
whom have intermarried with the Visayas, or &ldquo;old
Christians.&rdquo; These Mandayas are now safe from attack. They give
their attention to cultivation, and are increasing in numbers and
rising in the scale of civilisation.</p>
<p>Ancestral-worship is their religion, and their <i>Dinatas</i>, or
wooden idols, are stained red with the sap of the narra tree. They have
priestesses whom they call <i>Bailanes</i>, and they are said to
occasionally make human sacrifices.</p>
<p>As amongst other tribes in Mindanao, the <i>Limbucun</i>, or
turtle-dove, is a sacred bird, and rice and fruit is placed for its use
on a small raised platform, and it is never molested.</p>
<p>They are organised in a strict feudal system, the headman or datto
of each village is in fact the only free man of his clan. The others
are S&aacute;copes&mdash;that is, followers or vassals who, as well as
the datto, possess slaves. A Mandaya datto can seldom raise more than
fifty spears; sometimes two or three federate, but expeditions on a
large scale cannot be undertaken, for it would be impossible to feed
several hundred men in their country, such is the poverty of the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Sometimes a small group of Mandaya dattos recognises as suzerain
some neighbouring datto of the piratical Moros, who always tries to
keep them isolated and to prevent any <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb339" href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>intercourse or trade
with the Christians, unless through themselves.</p>
<p>The Mandayas have canoes and bamboo rafts on the streams and rivers
running through their territory. They catch a good many fish.</p>
<p>Their agriculture is on a very reduced scale, and is limited to
small plantations of rice and sweet potatoes near their villages; they
keep poultry. They do not dare to travel far from their houses for fear
they might be seized for slaves, or even sold to be sacrificed on the
death of a datto. Sometimes when a man has been condemned to death for
some crime his datto sells him to some person requiring a victim for
the death-vengeance, if he is assured that it is intended to kill him.
The datto thus combines the execution of justice with a due regard to
his own profit.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Mangu&aacute;ngas (5).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to Blumentritt, this tribe lives in the
Cordillera Sagat, and extends as far as the Great Lake Boayan or
Magindanao, and an old estimate gives their number as 80,000. On his
map he shows, the Lake and River Boayan in dotted lines, the latter is
made to fall into the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>On two modern maps of Mindanao which I have, one by Jesuits and the
other from Don Jose Nieto Aguilar&rsquo;s book on this Island, neither
the river nor the lake appear; but, in their stead, a lofty range of
mountains is shown. In each of these maps the Mangu&aacute;nga
territory occupies an entirely different location.</p>
<p>As the Jesuits have three <i lang="es"><span class="corr" id=
"xd20e11710" title="Source: reduccions">reducciones</span></i> or
villages amongst this tribe, I accept their map as constructed
according to the latest information. They show in their earlier maps
the Mangu&aacute;nga territory at the head of the Bay of Davao, its
southern frontier being some twelve miles from the sea, and about the
head-waters of the River Salug and the River Agusan.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">reducciones</i> are called Gandia, Pilar, and
Compostela. In the general Report of the Jesuit Missions of 1896, the
mission station of Jativa is stated to consist of six
<i>reducciones</i> of Manobos, Mandayas and Mangu&aacute;ngas, with a
total population of 1389.</p>
<p>In the general report of the following year the Mangu&aacute;ngas
and other tribes are not specifically mentioned, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>and
the total population of the mission station of Jativa is given as
1458.</p>
<p>In a later ethnographical map of Mindanao the Mangu&aacute;nga
territory appears still more circumscribed, being limited to a strip of
land between the Rivers Julep and Nabo, affluents of the River Agusan;
Nieto&rsquo;s map, however, shows them extending over the Eastern
Cordillera towards Linguit, which is situated on the coast in about
7&deg; 50&prime; N. latitude.</p>
<p>Dr. Montano, who went up the Rio Salug in 1880, passing through the
Mangu&aacute;nga territory, says he found the banks deserted.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that this once numerous tribe has been reduced
to a mere remnant, part settled in the before-mentioned <i lang=
"es">reducciones</i>, and part still wandering in mountains.</p>

<h3 class="main">Mont&eacute;ses or Buquidn&oacute;nes (6).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Spanish word Mont&eacute;s, means hill-man.
Buquid, in Tagal, means arable land; and Taga-buquid, a countryman. The
Tagal equivalent of hill-man is Taga-bundoc, which corresponds to the
jungle-wallah of British India. The word Buquidn&oacute;nes may mean
cultivators, and their extensive plantations fully justify this
designation. It is therefore rather a vague expression, but still
designates a particular tribe in Mindanao, whose numbers were estimated
to amount to 13,000 ten years ago, and who have probably largely
increased since then.</p>
<p>They occupy the valleys through which the Rivers of Cagayan and
Tagoloan run, and the hills between them and on both sides.</p>
<p>They hold the country of the head-waters of the Pulangui, and the
right bank, as far south as the Manobos extend on the left bank, say to
7&deg; 30&prime; N. latitude. In the north they extend right up into
the peninsula between the Bay of Macajalar and the Bay of Lunao,
occupying the lofty mountains of Sabrac, Sinalagao, Quimanquil, and the
sacred Balatucan, whence the souls of the dead jump from earth to
heaven.</p>
<p>Father Clotet, from whose letters to his superiors I have taken
these particulars, considers them to be divided into three large
groups.</p>
<p>The first consists of those living in the hills and valleys of the
rivers Tagoloan, Cagayan, and Iponam; the second, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>of
those bordering on the Manobos of the Agusan between Gingoog and
Nasipit, and the third of those who live on the right bank of the
Pulangui and on some of its affluents.</p>
<p>They bear some resemblance to their neighbours the Manobos, being of
good stature, well-built, even handsome, and are of an affable and
friendly disposition; some of them are so smart and well-bred as to be
not in the least inferior to the most civilised of the Visayas, and to
judge by their free and open address, and the absence of all
affectation when settling their business with the old Christians,
nobody would take them for heathens.</p>
<p>Father Urios said that, from the extent of their intelligence, they
were fit to be kings of the Manobos, so much superior were they to
these.</p>
<p>In their dress they show a far greater idea of decorum and modesty
than any other race in Mindanao, both men and women. The latter wear a
white shirt, which is held in at the waist by a long skirt, reaching to
the ankles. Over this they wear a very short and tight jacket, to the
edges of which they sew strips of cloth of many colours in a pleasing
tracery, the short wide sleeves being trimmed in the same way.</p>
<p>They show great taste in choosing the colours and designs with which
they ornament their dresses. On the left side at the waist they hang
some bead ornaments, small bells, and bunches of scented herbs. On
their legs they wear many loose rings of brass, copper, or silver,
which rattle when they walk. Their manner of dressing their hair is
singular, and characteristic. They take the bulk of the hair, and
without plaiting it they twist and knot it in a high and large coil.
All round the head fall curls cut to one length, but on the forehead
there is a fringe coming down almost to the eye-brows. They secure the
coil with a handsome and showy comb, well made of metal, or precious
metals, according to the means of the wearer. Many of them are loaded
with bracelets from the wrists to near the elbows, either of metal, of
tortoise-shell, or mother-of-pearl. In their ears they wear large
ornaments called <i>balaring</i>, made of a plug of soft wood, having
on each end a circular plate of brass, copper, silver, or of engraved
gold, one larger than the other. The hole of the ear is greatly
stretched to allow the smaller plate to pass through; the plug then
remains in the hole, and is covered at each end by the plates. They
wear also necklaces, sometimes of great <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb342" href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>value. These
manufactures seem to be very similar to those of the Igorrotes, which
have been detailed at length in the description of that interesting
people.</p>
<p>Father Clotet mentioned a curious necklace worn by one of these
women, formed of ancient silver coins, diminishing in size from the
centre to the extremities. In the middle was a silver dollar of Charles
III. He considered this to be worth thirty dollars, which was quite a
capital to a Mont&eacute;s in a small hamlet.</p>
<p>Even when pressed by necessity they will not sell these ornaments,
and they consequently pass from father to son for many generations.
They wear rings of brass, silver or gold, not only on their fingers,
but also on their toes.</p>
<p>The dress of the men on ordinary occasions is quite simple, but on
grand occasions they wear long trousers of European cloth, jackets of
the same stuff, and fine beaver hats. Their shirts of fine linen are
not worn outside the trousers as amongst the Tagals, only the front
being shown, which is often beautifully embroidered. Those amongst them
who, although heathens, have a frequent intercourse with the
Christians, have their hair cut short and take great care of it; but
those living amongst the hills let it grow long, and, rolling it into a
knot, tie it up in a kerchief like the <i>charros</i> of Aragon. Some
of them paint their teeth black, and file them into points. The wealthy
men and women cover their teeth with thin gold plates, like the chiefs
amongst the Igorrotes, but unlike them they take them off to eat. It
would seem to be indecent to show one&rsquo;s teeth to any person of
superior rank.</p>
<p>They believe in a future life, and are polytheists. They worship the
gods of the cardinal points: the god of the north is called
Domalongdong; he of the south, Ongli; of the east, Tagolambong; of the
west, Magbabaya.</p>
<p>This last god, Magbabaya, which means Almighty, has, however, two
other gods of equal rank: Ibabasag and Ipamahandi. The first is invoked
for the safe delivery of pregnant women; the second takes care of the
horses and cattle, and as there is hardly a Buquidnon who does not
possess some of these animals to assist him in his labour, Ipamahandi
is constantly called upon to help them when any accident happens.</p>
<p>Tagum-Ban&uacute;a, the god of the fields, is prayed to for a good
harvest, and a feast called the <i>Caliga</i>, corresponding to our
harvest festival, is held in his honour. The Tao-sa-sulup, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>or
men of the woods, correspond to the Tic-Balan of the old heathen
Tagals, and inhabit the trunks of secular trees, especially the Balete,
or rocky crags or caves, intervening in the affairs of mortals to
favour them or upset them. Consequently they make sacrifices to these
spirits to propitiate them and gain their favour.</p>
<p>Tigbas is a much respected god, looked upon with special reverence
as having come down from heaven. He is represented by stone idols on
stone pedestals, only possessed by the principal dattos, who keep them
amongst the heir-looms of their ancestors, and only allow their near
relations or intimate friends to see them.</p>
<p>Talian is a small idol in the figure of a monkey squatting, usually
made from the root of the willow. This they carry about with them,
hanging from a cord round its neck. When on a journey, if they fear an
ambush, they hold out the cord with the little idol on it like a
plumb-line, and let it spin. When it comes to rest, its face is turned
in the direction where the enemy is concealed. They then carefully
avoid that direction, if they have been following it, by turning off
and taking another path. If one of them is ill, they submerge the idol
in a cup of water which he immediately drinks. Otherwise, by simply
touching the suffering part, they find relief, and even a radical
cure.</p>
<p>The Busao, an evil spirit, must be kept in good humour, and to this
end they offer to it meat and drink, and sing and dance in its honour,
praying to it to deliver them from any calamity they fear.</p>
<p>The elders are charged with the duty of offering fruits and of
sacrificing the pigs and fowls to the deities. It will be seen what a
strong religious bias prevails amongst these people, who are convinced
that all the affairs of life are in the hands of Divine Providence, and
of the necessity of prayer and sacrifice.</p>
<p>Marriages amongst them are arranged by the parents or by the head
chief of their tribe, the Masalicampo (Maestro de Campo). A house is
prepared for the young couple, and an abundant feast is made ready,
including an ample supply of a fermented drink called <i>pangasi</i>,
which is preserved in large jars. When the guests have assembled, and
everything is ready, the bride and bridegroom exchange a few words, and
each receives from their respective fathers a small morsel of cooked
rice. This they hold out for a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344"
href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>short time on the palms of
their hands, and then each places the morsel in the mouth of the other,
and this action solemnises the marriage. The Tagban&uacute;as have the
same custom.</p>
<p>Immediately an animated conversation bursts out amongst the guests,
and a profuse and carefully-cooked feast is served.</p>
<p>To the feast succeeds a prolonged drinking bout, the guests sucking
up the liquor through straws or canes from the jars which contain it.
Amongst the Mont&eacute;ses it is not considered good form to return
home from a wedding ostentatiously sober.</p>
<p>Polygamy is allowed, but little practised, only the dattos having
two or perhaps three wives.</p>
<p>Father Barrado, who was a missionary amongst them, remarked on the
repugnance these people have to pass through the territory of some
other datto, and Dr. Montano, who crossed Mindanao from Davao to
Butuan, confirms this very fully as regards Mandayas and Manobos. In
order that they may do this in safety, the principal dattos have a
large and highly-ornamented lance called a <i>quiap</i>. In return for
a small fee they lend this to any of their S&aacute;copes who desire to
pass through another datto&rsquo;s territory as a passport, or safe
conduct. When carrying this lance, far from being molested, travellers
are treated with consideration and deference, even in time of war.</p>
<p>The principal dattos show their grandeur by having enormous jars, in
which they preserve their heir-looms or rare and curious objects, or
use for holding provisions. Gongs also are much esteemed amongst them.
But their most precious possessions are certain wooden-boxes or trunks
with copper coins nailed all over them in patterns, in which they keep
their clothes and arms. In this they resemble the rajahs and sultans of
the Malays. They use swords and lances, <i>bolos</i>, and sometimes the
Malay kris with inscriptions and marks in Arabic, these last are got
from the Moros. Some of their arms are beautifully made with carved
handles of hard wood, and inlaid with silver, having sheaths of
polished wood. Some of them have coats of mail, made of brass plates
and wires, ornamented with silver. These appear to be of great
antiquity, and it is not known where they came from originally. Others
have quilted jackets such as Cortes found amongst the Mexicans.
Notwithstanding their amiable characteristics, they make <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>forays like the Manobos, and attack other
tribes, killing the adults, and carrying off the children as slaves and
the girls as concubines.</p>
<p>They use the pneumatic tinder-box like the Igorrotes. They are fond
of smoking, and raise large crops of excellent tobacco, selling their
surplus in Cagayan de Misamis. They prefer to smoke their tobacco in
pipes, which they make themselves. They also chew buyo. On their
voyages they carry pouches to contain their belongings, and a curious
crescent-shaped box made of brass plate, which they tie on in
front.</p>
<p>Although able to make long journeys on foot, they usually ride, and
are excellent horsemen, riding up and down the steepest paths. Their
horses are adorned with one or two necklaces of sleigh-bells, so that
they can be heard approaching from a distance.</p>
<p>They have no calendar, but know from the appearance of certain
constellations in the heavens, to which they give names of their own,
that the rainy season is approaching, and they then set to work busily
to prepare their land for sowing or planting.</p>
<p>They use the plough, and make extensive plantations of maize, which
is their principal article of food, and also of rice, they sell the
surplus to the inhabitants of the coast towns, for articles they
require, especially salt. They make small stone hand-mills for grinding
maize, and what is much more curious, they have invented and
manufactured cotton gins, having two wooden rollers geared together,
worked by a crank on the upper one. These gins work with great
regularity.</p>
<p>In 1889 they were much interested in planting and preparing
<i>Abac&aacute;</i>, and Gingoog, one of their outlets, exported no
less than 11,000 piculs, or the equivalent of 5500 bales in twelve
months. They also take down to the coast-towns quantities of wax and
resin. Their labour ought to make them wealthy, but here again we find
the rascally Chinaman, who, intoxicating them with some vile spirits,
deceives them in the price, cheats them in the weight, and sends them
back sick and ill from their unaccustomed libations, with some wretched
rubbish in exchange for their valuable produce. By this means their
industry is checked, and those who take down goods return in worse
plight than they went. Any decent Government would prohibit the
demoralisation of this interesting people, but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span>the
Chinaman well understands how to deal with the local Spanish
authorities, and even subscribes largely to the church, for he likes to
have two strings to his bow.</p>
<p>The musical instruments of the Mont&eacute;ses are clarinets,
flutes, guitars of three strings, and a small drum.</p>
<p>At the time of the harvest, from the first peep of day to sunrise,
before beginning to work, they sing or chant certain songs, the men and
women taking alternate verses.</p>
<p>They have courts of justice to punish robbery and other offences.
Their laws are traditional, passing from father to son, and
occasionally altered at the discretion of the principal datto, to whom
they appeal if they have been gravely offended. The principal datto
having taken his seat, his head is bound round with the pinditon, or
head-cloth, with three points, and he takes the <i>quiap</i> (already
mentioned) in his hand. He then invites two inferior dattos, who
<span class="corr" id="xd20e11842" title="Source: takes">take</span>
seats one on each side of him. The prisoner is then led forward by a
guard, who <span class="corr" id="xd20e11845" title=
"Source: stick">sticks</span> their lances in the earth near the seats
of the tribunal. The case is argued on both sides, the court
deliberates and gives judgment and sentence, which is executed upon the
spot, fine, corporal-punishment, or death. This is quite an ideal
criminal court, and worthy of all respect.</p>
<p>Amongst them it is considered as a want of education and good
manners to mention their own names, and if a stranger asks, &ldquo;What
is your name?&rdquo; the person interrogated does not answer, but some
one else replies, &ldquo;His name is so-and-so.&rdquo; This actually
happened to me amongst the Tagban&uacute;as of Paragua, when I visited
them. (<i>See</i> Tagban&uacute;as.)</p>
<p>They believe in omens, and have many curious customs, too long to
relate, but I shall mention one.</p>
<p>If a stranger enters a house to visit those who inhabit it, and
during the conversation a fowl should fly and pass before him, the
people of the house instantly kill it, and cooking it as quickly as
possible, they eat it in company with the visitor to allay his fright,
and cause his soul to return to his body, for it might have left him
when he was startled.</p>
<p>The houses in their villages are large and well-built, sometimes the
walls are of thick planks of hard wood tied together with rattan, for
they use no nails. The houses in the country are smaller, and low in
the roof, but always so high from the ground that the longest lance
will not reach the floor.</p>

<p>Great respect is shown to the dead. They are usually buried in their
fields with lance, sword, and bolo laid beside them. They make a mound
of earth over the grave, fixing several stakes like St Andrew&rsquo;s
crosses, and protecting the whole with the bark of a tree fastened over
the stakes. From a high post hangs a bag of rice, that the soul of the
defunct may sustain itself on the long journey to Mount Bolotucan, the
highest peak of the whole region. The soul having arrived on this peak,
gives one great jump, and reaches heaven, at a higher or lower level,
according to the greater or lesser probity of its life on earth.
Wherever it lands, there it remains to all eternity. The relations make
great lamentations at the death, and loose their hair which they do not
roll up for a greater or lesser period, according to the love they bore
the dead.</p>
<p>It is pleasing to be able again to state that the bravery, the
wisdom, and the faith and charity of the Jesuits exercised amongst this
race has had a rich reward. During the four years which concluded in
1889, no less than 6600 heathen Mont&eacute;ses renounced their
superstitions, their polygamy, and their slave-hunting murdering raids,
and, accepting the doctrines of our Saviour, were baptized into the
Christian faith. Besides the older coast towns, mostly occupied by
Visayas, twenty-four Christian villages extend from the Bay of
Macajalar far into the Mont&eacute;se country, now giving the hand to
the military garrisons on the Rio Grande amongst those irreclaimable
pirates the Moros.</p>
<p>The Cross was triumphing over the Crescent in Mindanao quite as
much, nay, much more, by the voices of the missionaries as by the
Spanish bayonets. It will be an outrage on Christianity, a blot on
their renown, if through ignorance or folly, the United States should
so act as to put a stop to this holy and civilising work, and so give
occasion for some future author to write another &ldquo;Century of
Dishonour.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These people occupy a considerable territory from the
River Libaganon, which falls into the Gulf of Davao round the northern
slopes of Mount Apo, about the head-waters of the rivers running into
Lakes Liguan and Buluan. To the north they have the Tagavauas and the
Manobos; to the south the Vilanes, and on the east the Guiangas,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>Bagobos and Calaganes. The swampy country on the
west separates them from the Moros of Lake Liguan. From the extent of
their territory the At&aacute;s are probably very numerous.</p>
<p>They appear to be a hybrid Malayo-Negrito race, but have advanced
considerably in social organisation. They go decently dressed, the men
wearing short drawers and a shirt of Chinese pattern, and the women a
<i>patadion</i> and an embroidered bodice&mdash;with strings of beads
round the neck for ornament. They weave stuffs similar to those made by
the neighbouring tribes. They are said to be of a determined character,
and to stand up to the Moros in defence of their families and
property.</p>
<p>They also attack other tribes and commit atrocious murders, not
sparing women and children.</p>
<p>A missionary passing near their territory on the River Libaganon in
November 1892, found several households in great grief on account of
unprovoked murders committed by the At&aacute;s.</p>
<p>As the At&aacute;s live remote from the sea-coast and have no
navigable rivers running through their territory, the missionaries have
not yet been able to make much impression on them, but they are working
their way up the Davao River, and the reduction of Belen established in
1891 is quite on the borders of the At&aacute;s territory. Murders,
slave-raids, and human sacrifices, are still the ordinary events of
At&aacute;s life.</p>
<p>The illustration shows two determined-looking At&aacute;s warriors
with spear and shield, two women and two young girls, all carefully
dressed and wearing their ornaments.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Guiangas live on the slopes of Mount Apo, to the
North of the Bagobos, whom they much resemble in manners and customs.
In view of the small territory they occupy, they cannot be
numerous.</p>
<p>They have a rather effeminate air, the men wearing their hair long;
but notwithstanding this, they are quite robust, of remarkable agility,
and very adroit in the use of arms.</p>

<p>Montano gives the average height of the man as 5 feet 4&frac12;
inches, and measured some up to 5 feet 7&frac12; inches. The men wear
short drawers and huge ear ornaments. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>Their weapons are the
bow and spear. They are organised on the same feudal system as the
other tribes being governed by their dattos. Their houses, as usual,
are built on high piles. They are tolerably industrious, and
occasionally work for the Visayas on their plantations. They possess
horses, cattle, and poultry, and make the usual plantations of rice,
camote, and maize.</p>
<p>As regards their religion, Tighiama is the Creator, and Manama the
governor of the world. Todlay, the god of love, is husband of the
Virgin Todlibun, and the women celebrate certain rites in his
honour.</p>
<p>Dewata is the protector of the house, and he is said to love blood.
It is therefore incumbent on the head of every household to avenge any
insult in the blood of the offender.</p>
<p>As amongst other tribes, the death of a datto, or of one of his
wives, requires a human sacrifice in number proportionate to the rank
of the defunct. The victims are usually taken from amongst the slaves
of the datto, but in some cases they are purchased by public
subscription. Being securely fastened to trees so that they cannot
move, the largest subscriber inflicts a stab&mdash;politely avoiding
giving a mortal wound, then the others follow in accordance with the
importance of their subscription. The cries of the victim, thus
gradually done to death, are drowned by the vociferations of his
executioners. These sacrifices are still carried on in the remoter
districts, but the missionaries are beginning to convert the Guiangas
nearest the coast, and have established several <i lang=
"es">reducciones</i> in Guianga territory, such as Garellano, Oran,
Guernica, Oyanguren. In the parish of Davao and its missions, there
were at the end of 1896 nearly 12,000 Christians, and the missionaries
were actively at work and were meeting with success. If they are
re-established, and supported, in a few years&rsquo; time human
sacrifices will only be a dread tradition of the past.</p>
<p>The illustration shows a group of Guiangas, both men and women, the
latter wearing many ornaments.</p>

<h3 class="main">Bagobos (9).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This small tribe occupies the southern and eastern
slopes of the Apo volcano, reaching down to the coast of the Bay of
Davao, between the River Taumo on the north, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span>and
the River Digos on the south. They also have an outlying settlement at
Piapi&mdash;now called Vera&mdash;on the Ensenada de Casilaran. The
lower part of their territory is swampy, and the inhabitants of this
district suffer from fever and ague, and present a sickly appearance.
They resemble the Manobos in disposition and in customs, and their
weapons are the same. Their dress consists of short drawers and a
jacket. The women wear a shirt and patadion. They are moderate in
eating, and cleanly in their persons. Dr. Montano greatly praises the
beauty of their country, especially about the banks of the Rio
Matina.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of the Bagobos is that they are horse-Indians,
everybody&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;rides in their
country.</p>
<p>They breed these horses, which are small, but endowed with
remarkable endurance, and their saddles, although rude, are
scientifically constructed, like miniature McClellans. They ride with
very short stirrups, and the men are always seen spear in hand when
mounted. They carefully preserve by tradition the genealogy of their
horses, and give their favourite animals a ration of 4&frac12; lbs. of
paddy per day, as well as grass.</p>
<p>The basis of their food is rice and sweet potatoes, which they
cultivate, using the buffalo and plough, and getting the manual labour
done by their slaves.</p>
<p>They plant coffee, cacao, and bananas, but having assured their
subsistence, they love to wander off into the woods to seek for
jungle-produce, such as wax, honey, alm&aacute;ciga, and the coarse
cinnamon of the country, all of which finds a ready sale on the
coast.</p>
<p>They are said to strictly perform all their engagements.</p>
<p>They cultivate abaca, and from the filament of this plant their
women weave the tissues called <i>dagmays</i>, which they polish by
rubbing them with shells till they take a lustre like silk. They dye
these stuffs in a primitive manner, but with satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The men are tolerable smiths, and forge their weapons from old iron,
which they obtain in barter. They make bits (for horses), and
bracelets, and collars of brass. Amongst them gold is said to be dearer
than in Paris, although the sands about Malalag, just south of their
territory, yield gold.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A small tribe living on the south-eastern slopes of
Mount Apo, about the head-waters of the River Digos, which runs into
the Gulf of Davao, a little north of the Ensenada de Casilaran.</p>
<p>They are reported to be of good stature, and of a dark colour, to
understand the language of the Vilanes, but to speak their own tongue,
which is similar to the Manobo. They are industrious cultivators of the
soil, and store provisions for their use, never suffering from famine,
but rather assisting others less careful. Their country is very broken,
consisting of deep valleys, divided from each other by lofty crests.
These valleys are full of people, so that the tribe must be
numerous.</p>
<p>Father Urios visited them in January of 1894, and was well treated.
The <i lang="es">reducciones</i> of Aviles and Melitta have been
recently formed amongst them, and their conversion was proceeding till
the war began. Their territory forms part of the parish and missions of
Davao.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Tagacaolos live in the district of Davao, on the
west coast of the gulf from Malalao as far south as Lais. There are
also some living on the peninsula of San Agustin, between Cuabo and
Macambol. Physically, they are inferior to the neighbouring tribes, not
so much in stature as in muscular development. They are timid, and
those who are still heathen select places for their hamlets that cannot
easily be surprised, such as rocks, or crags without forest round them,
although this obliges them to carry water from a great distance.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span></p>
<p>A considerable number of them have been converted, and settled in
hamlets near the coast, but the mass of them are still heathen.</p>
<p>Their faces are long, the nose thin, and the extremity of it
slightly curved.</p>
<p>They are the victims of the Bagobos and Guiangas, who attack them
for the purpose of carrying them off into slavery. They themselves prey
on the Vilanes, who are less capable of defence, and make slaves of
them. They also fight amongst themselves. They make human sacrifices to
their god Mandarangan, who lives in the crater of the Apo volcano, to
avert his wrath, and when any noise is heard from the volcano, they
consider that he is demanding a victim.</p>
<p>In 1896, more than 300 Tagacaolos had been baptized, and were living
in a civilised manner in the town of Malalag, now called Las Mercedes.
The conversion of this tribe was being actively carried on by the
assistants of the veteran missionary, Father Urios, who resided in
Davao until the Spanish-American war. Las Mercedes was improving, and
promised to become a town of some importance.</p>
<p>A detachment of infantry was stationed there.</p>
<p>The influence of the missionaries extended beyond the <i lang=
"es">reducciones</i>, and had some effect amongst the heathen in
discouraging human sacrifices and tribal wars. It may be expected that,
before long, these dreadful rites will be put an end to, if the
missionaries are enabled to return.</p>

square to the south of the Tirurayes, which extends from the crests of
the mountains to the coast. On the east they have the Vilanes. I have
not been able to learn anything whatever about this people, nor, so far
as I know, are there any <i lang="es">reducciones</i> in their
territory.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Tirurayes occupy the hills to the south of the
delta of the Rio Grande, the coast being occupied by Moros.</p>
<p>They are reported to be of low type, physically, and to hold the
chastity of their wives and daughters as of no account. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span></p>
<p>The proximity of the Moros probably accounts for this looseness of
morals. The missionaries have been working amongst them for years, and
in 1891 they had baptized 109. However, the converts were not settled
in towns, but wandered about the hills as they liked. Since then, more
of them have been baptized, and were settled in Tamontaca, and several
<i lang="es">reducciones</i> have been founded in their territory. In
Tamontaca, during 1896, between heathen and Moros, there were 152
conversions and baptisms during the year, besides 197 baptisms of
infants born of Christian parents. The Tagacaolos used to apply to the
missionaries for everything they required&mdash;medicine for the sick,
Spanish red wine for women after child-birth, or boards to make
coffins. So the missionaries not only had to bury them for nothing, but
had to find them the coffin into the bargain.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Tirurayes declined to cut timber for the
chapels at their <i lang="es">reducciones</i>, or to haul it to place,
or to do any kind of work unless paid for it. Their zeal does not lead
them to do anything for the Church as a free offering. They find it
very hard to break themselves of their nomadic customs, and are
particularly apt to <i lang="es">remontar</i>. However, they treated
the missionaries with great respect, and these could go anywhere
amongst them without danger.</p>
<p>Since the war, the missionaries have abandoned Tamontaca, and the
whole neighbourhood is in disorder.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These people inhabit the islands of Samal and Talicud,
in the Gulf of Davao, and are not to be confounded with the Moros
Samales of Tawi-tawi and Jolo.</p>
<p>The Samales surpass both the Moros and Nisayas in muscular
development and stature.</p>
<p>Their feet and hands are large; they have high and projecting
cheek-bones, and a stiff beard standing out <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>round the face gives it, according to Montano,
something of a cat-like appearance. Both sexes dress like the
Moros.</p>
<p>They are less ferocious than their neighbours, and do not, like
them, go about armed.</p>
<p>They do not commit any aggressions, and are industrious. In
character, they are superior to the Moros, and are not like
them&mdash;cunning and deceitful.</p>
<p>They have been on good terms with the Spaniards for a long time, but
until quite lately they were very obstinate, and could not be persuaded
to be baptized.</p>
<p>They cultivate the usual crops, fish, and make salt. The women weave
<i>dagmays</i>.</p>
<p>They used to have slaves, whom they purchased from the Moros or
Manobos, and treated them well.</p>
<p>Formerly, they enclosed their dead in wooden coffins, made in two
parts, the shallower part serving as a lid. Each piece was hollowed out
of a solid log. They placed the coffins on a rude platform in a cave or
niche in the rocks, or else built a thatched roof over it to keep off
the rain.</p>
<p>They placed near the coffin buyo and bonga for chewing, and vases
containing rice and maize. Each year after the harvest they went to
visit the dead, and renewed the offerings.</p>
<p>Little is known of their former religion, but they worshipped the
serpent, and believed in the immortality of the soul, and in a place of
punishment by fire, which they called Quilut.</p>
<p>The patience and zeal of the missionaries has, however, been richly
rewarded, and in June, 1894, a number of Samales were baptized,
including most of their dattos. By the autumn of that year there was
not a heathen left in the islands, and the Samales are now settled in
seven villages&mdash;San Jos&eacute;, San Ramon, Alcira, Tarifa,
Carmona, Cervera, and Pe&ntilde;a Plata. This last was the residence of
the missionary, who was accompanied by a lay brother. The population at
the beginning of 1897 was 1625.</p>

<p>They are short and thickset, with little agility.</p>
<p>Montano describes them as having flat, broad noses, underhung jaws,
and receding foreheads, giving them an appearance of stupidity.</p>
<p>Father Urios, however, writing about the Vilanes of Sarangani and
Balut, gives a more favourable description of them. He says they are
docile and industrious, and more active and intelligent than the Moros
Sanguiles, who live on these same islands.</p>
<p>He thought them easy to convert, for they have no religious system
of their own; but they believe in God, and in the immortality of the
soul.</p>
<p>Although living so near the Moros, they have not adopted any of
their religious ideas.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Subanos (17).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The word Subanos means dwellers by the rivers, from
suba&mdash;a river.</p>
<p>This numerous tribe inhabits the western peninsula of Mindanao from
Misamis to Zamboanga, except the coasts which are mostly occupied by
Visayas or Moros.</p>
<p>They are of a darker colour and inferior in physique to the Mandayas
and Mont&eacute;ses.</p>
<p>Like other races in Mindanao the Subanos are organised under dattos
or baganis in a feudal system. It is said that he who has killed one
enemy may wear a red head-cloth, whilst other tribes only concede this
distinction to a warrior who has killed five.</p>
<p>In religion, they are polytheists, and worship the following deities
amongst others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tagma-sa-dugat, or Lord of the Sea.</li>
<li>Tagma-sa-yuta, or Lord of the Earth.</li>
<li>Tagma-sa-manga bugund, or Lord of the Woods.</li>
<li>Tagma-sa-manga Suba, or Lord of the Rivers.</li>
<li>Tagma-sa-Saquit, or Lord Protector of the sick.</li>
</ul>
<p>But they are said not to possess wooden idols like the Manobos,
Mandayas and Mont&eacute;ses. They raise rough <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>altars of sticks, on which they lay out
offerings to their deities. They call these altars Paga-paga. The
offerings consist of rice, chickens, eggs, buyo and tobacco, also a
large jar of <i>pangasi</i>, a beer brewed from rice. When making their
offerings, they sing, dance, and pray round the altar to the sound of
the <i>sucaran</i>, a rough kind of cymbal or gong. Amongst the Subanos
only the dattos or rich men have more than one wife. The marriage
ceremonies are very elaborate, and conclude with two great feasts or
drinking bouts, one in the house of the bride&rsquo;s father, the other
in the house of the bridegroom. Divorce can be obtained if the couple
cannot agree, or if either quarrels with the father- or mother-in-law.
It is not readily conceded, and the case is sometimes argued for days
before the council of elders of the village. Children are only given
names when four or five years old. The Subanos have no money in
circulation, and any trading is effected by barter.</p>
<p>They bury their dead the day after their decease, wrapping the body
in a mat. The grave is dug about a yard deep, and near the house. The
<i>Balian</i> or priest accompanies the bearers, and sprinkles water on
the house and ground as he goes. Women do not accompany the funeral
party. The body is laid on a bed of leaves, resting on a framework of
sticks or canes at the bottom of the grave. The sides are protected in
the same way, and over it another framework is constructed, carrying an
earthen jar containing food and clothing. The weapons of the defunct
are laid over him, and the grave is filled in with earth, great care
being taken not to let a particle of it touch the body. Sacrifices are
made to the god Diuata; these constitute the funeral feast, which is
consumed in silence. When it is concluded, the dishes and pots which
contained it are turned upside down.</p>
<p>On the eighth day another feast is held, when they talk and dance,
intoxicating themselves with copious libations of pangasi. The priest
then goes through a ceremony the purport of which is to hand over the
soul of the defunct to Diuata-sa-langit, the god of heaven<span class=
"corr" id="xd20e12142" title="Source: , he">. He</span> begs the soul
to go away with the god, and to trouble them no more. They then renew
the dancing and drinking, and thus conclude the period of mourning.</p>
<p>The houses of the Subanos are similarly constructed to those of the
Manobos, Mont&eacute;ses, and other tribes, but are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>not
always raised so high from the ground, and are more roughly built.
Their food is similar to that of the other heathen tribes. The men wear
their hair long, but coiled up on the head, and covered with a kerchief
worn like a turban. They dress in a tight jacket and trousers, either
white, blue, or red. Sometimes they wear a sash. The men do not wear
ear-ornaments of any kind. The women wear large combs made by
themselves from bamboos, but no head-covering. Their ornaments are
ear-rings, strings of beads round the neck, and many bangles or
bracelets of brass or silver. They are clothed in a short shirt, either
of homespun or Manchester cotton, and a skirt worn tight round the
body, and reaching below the knees.</p>
<p>The weapons of the Subanos are the lance, which they call
<i>talanan</i>, a round shield they call <i>taming</i>, a scimitar they
call <i>campilan</i>, the Malay kris they call <i>caliz</i>, the
machete or <i>pes</i>.</p>
<p>Their agriculture and industries are very primitive, and on a small
scale.</p>
<p>They have scarcely any other musical instrument than brass gongs
called <i>Agum</i>, which are played as dance music to their two
dances, the <i>Saldiringan</i> and the <i>Sinigay</i>. In the first of
these dances the men stand up in a row, opposite a row of women. All
hold a palm-branch in each hand with which to beat time. They jump up
and down with eyes fixed on the ground.</p>
<p>For the <i>Sinigay</i>, however, the partners touch each
other&rsquo;s hands, but only with the points of the fingers. The
Subano, equivalent to our Mrs. Grundy, would feel shocked to see
gentlemen dancing with their arms round their partners&rsquo;
waists.</p>
<p>The principal feast is called Birclog, and it lasts eight days. A
large shed is built, the priests offer prayers to the before-mentioned
gods, and sacrifice swine and poultry. The pigs are strangled by a rope
held or jerked by all the priests, and are placed on the altar one at a
time. Above the carcass is placed a live cock, which they kill by
wounding it through the mouth and letting it bleed to death. They also
offer tobacco, rice, and <i>pangasi</i>.</p>
<p>The offerings are taken away to be cut up and cooked. They are then
served, and the <i>pangasi</i> goes round, the priests being always
served first and getting the best of everything, as seems to be the
case all the world over.</p>
<p>When the first lot of people have been fed, they vacate <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span>the
shed, which is instantly filled by a fresh lot. Sometimes in one of
these feasts they consume twenty pigs and forty ten-gallon jars of the
strong rice-beer. When intoxicated, their conduct, according to Father
Sanchez, S.J., is apt to overstep the bounds of propriety, but in this
they are very much like more civilised people in the same
condition.</p>
<p>The only vessels possessed by the Subanos are some canoes, or
dug-outs, on the rivers. These are sometimes of great length, and are
called by them <i>Sacayan</i>. They propel them with great skill, using
a long double-ended paddle which they use standing up, and alternately
on either side. Like many other races of the Far East, they consider a
lunar eclipse as the precursor of great calamities, and make a
deafening noise to frighten away the serpent or dragon which is
swallowing the moon. They consider the turtle-dove, or <i>limocon</i>,
as an omen-bird, and will halt or perhaps return if they hear its cry
when starting on a journey. Also if they hear any one sneeze whilst
going down the ladder of the house, they return, and remain within
doors.</p>
<p>Some of the Subanos bear Moro titles, such as Timuay, which is
equivalent to third class judge. Father Vilaclara, S.J., a bold and
enterprising missionary, visited, in 1890, the house of a Subano named
Audos, who had recently succeeded his father as Timuay of the Sindangan
River.</p>
<p>He counted twenty-nine persons, great and small, in the house, but
this did not include the whole family, as several were absent at their
occupations. The house was built on piles, according to the universal
custom, and the floor could not be reached from the ground by the
longest lance. It measured eighteen yards long by ten yards wide, and
formed one vast apartment, there being no partitions of any kind. The
floor was made of strips of bamboo, and on this account it must be out
of reach, for as the inhabitants sleep on grass mats laid on the floor,
they could easily be speared in the night through the interstices of
the canes.</p>
<p>Five married couples and their children occupied this apartment,
each having its own part of the floor, its own store of rice, its own
pigs and poultry. Each family cooked and ate independently, but all
showed the greatest respect to the aged grandparents, and consulted
them about their affairs. Father Vilaclara appears to have ultimately
converted the whole family, beginning with the boys, whom he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>took under his charge, dressed and fed them, and
taught them to speak Visaya.</p>
<p>Gold-washing and gold-mining is practised by the Subanos between
Dapitan and Misamis, where there is a vast extension of gold-bearing
sand and earth. Near Pigtao auriferous iron pyrites occurs. The native
name for this ore is Inga.</p>
<p>Horses are very abundant in the district of Misamis, and in common
use for riding and as pack carriers.</p>
<p>The Subanos have the reputation of being war-like, yet until lately
they were entirely dominated by the Moros wherever they came in
contact. Since 1893 the Spaniards have isolated them from the Ilanao
Moros by establishing a chain of forts, and making a Trocha, or
military road, across the narrow neck of land from Tucuran on the Bahia
Illana to Balatacan on Bahia Panquil. The width of the isthmus here is
about sixteen miles, and the forts are called Alfonso XIII, Infanta
Isabel, Sta. Paz, and Sta. Eulalia, and Maria Cristina.</p>
<p>The Subanos appear to be much more refractory to civilisation and
Christianity than the Mont&eacute;ses, the Manobos or the Mandayas.
This no doubt comes from the strong influence that vile nests of
pirates and slave-traders around Lake Lanao has for centuries exercised
over them, but in time the Trocha, if kept as it should be, in the
interests of civilisation, will destroy that.</p>
<p>The Jesuit missionaries were actively at work round about the Bay of
Dapitan in the extreme north of the Subano territory, and to some
extent round about Zamboanga in the extreme south, until the war
between Spain and America broke out.</p>
<p>In the Dapitan district there were at the end of 1896 nearly 15,000
Christians residing in the towns and villages under the spiritual, and
temporal guidance of the Jesuits. During that year 208 heathen were
baptized in the Dapitan district, but only 21 in the Zamboanga
district.</p>
<p>It is safe to assume that in the Dapitan district alone there are
10,000 Christian Subanos.</p>
<p>The number of heathen Subanos, amongst whom there are a few
semi-Mahometans, may be about 90,000. From these figures it is quite
evident that the missionary enterprise should be extended, but in order
to do this the insolence of the Moros must be chastised. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Moros, or Mahometan Malays (18 to 23).</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These terrible pirates who have for centuries laid
waste the coasts of the Philippines and the adjacent islands, with fire
and sword, carrying off tens of thousands of Christians or heathen into
slavery, have only within the last few years had their power definitely
broken by the naval and military forces of Spain and by the labours of
the Jesuit missionaries, amongst the heathen tribes of the island.</p>
<p>It is scarcely half a century since they annually attacked the
Visayas Islands and even Southern Luzon, and they have been, up to
quite lately, the great obstacle to the civilisation of the Southern
Philippines. In Culion, Cuyos and other islands the churches are built
within a stone fort, in which the population took refuge when the Moros
appeared. The old Spanish sailing men-of-war could not cope with these
sea rovers, who in their light prahus, salisipanes, or vintas, kept in
shallow water or amongst reefs where these vessels could not reach
them. Of course, if the pirates were surprised when crossing open
water, they ran great risks, since their artillery was always very
deficient, but they sailed in great numbers, and if it fell calm they
would cluster round a solitary man-of-war and take her by boarding.</p>
<p>In consequence, a special force was raised in the Philippines to
protect the coasts against these pests. It was called &ldquo;La Marina
Sutil,&rdquo; or the Light Navy. This force consisted of large
flat-bottomed launches propelled <span class="corr" id="xd20e12244"
title="Source: hy">by</span> oars and sails. They were half-decked
forward, and carried a long brass gun, on a slide, and some swivels on
the quarters. These boats were coppered and fitted with a cabin at the
after part. They carried forty or fifty men, all natives, and squadrons
of them were stationed at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362"
href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>principal southern ports from
whence they patrolled the coasts. Most of the officers were natives or
mestizos; some of them survive to this day. These vessels rendered good
service, and to some extent checked the incursions of the pirates, but
they had not the speed to follow up the fast-rowing <i>vintas</i> of
the Moros, which could always escape from them unless caught in narrow
waters. In 1824, D. Alonso Morgado was appointed Captain of the Marina
Sutil, and severely chastised the Moros.</p>
<p>Some of these rowing gun-boats are still to be seen rotting on the
beach at the southern naval stations. But the introduction of steam
gun-boats in 1860 gradually did away with the Marina Sutil, and sounded
the knell of piracy in the Philippines. The Moros received terrible
chastisement at the hands of these steam gun-boats, one of which, with
a crew of only forty men, has been known to destroy a whole fleet of
pirates, and now their power on the sea has become only a dread
tradition of the past.</p>
<p>Even with all the advantages of steam propulsion, their suppression
has been a matter of the utmost difficulty, for the Moros are not only
possessed of the greatest personal valour, but are extremely skilful in
taking advantage of every circumstance that can favour their
defence.</p>
<p>Their towns are mostly built in the water, like the City of Brunei,
the houses having bamboo bridges to connect them with the shore, which
can be removed when desirable. They select a site well protected by
reefs or islands, or only to be approached by long and tortuous
channels through mangrove swamps enfiladed by guns cunningly concealed
from view; a very death-trap to an attack by boats.</p>
<p>On rising ground and flanking their settlements they built their
<i>Cottas</i> or forts. The walls of these strongholds are a double
stockade of great trunks of trees, the space between them being filled
with rock, stones, or earth rammed in. Some of these walls are 24 feet
thick and as much as 30 feet high, defended by brass and iron guns, and
by numerous <i>lantacas</i>. Such places can stand a deal of battering,
and are not easily taken by assault, for the Moros mount the ramparts
and make a brave defence, firing grape from their guns and lantacas,
and as the assailants approach, hurling their spears on them to a
surprising distance, with accurate aim, and <span class="corr" id=

them in the breaches.</p>

<p>Should the assault slacken they never fail to rush out, helmet on
head, clad in coats of mail, and with sword and buckler engage the foe
in a desperate hand-to-hand struggle where quarter is neither asked nor
given.</p>
<p>The annals of Moro-Spanish war include many well-contested combats,
where, to use the language of Froissart, &ldquo;many heavy blows were
given and received,&rdquo; where the most desperate exertions of
Spain&rsquo;s bravest officers, backed up by their war-like and hardy
troops, not seldom failed to carry the forts held by the indomitable
and fanatic Moros. Such Homeric combats were those between that dreaded
Sultan of Mindanao, Cachit Corralat and Don Sebastian Hurtado de
Corcuera, and Captain Atienzas&rsquo; bold attack on the hosts of the
confederated Moros of Lake Lanao. Nor were the Spanish missionaries
less active than the soldiers on the field of battle, or in the most
<span class="corr" id="xd20e12285" title=
"Source: deperate">desperate</span> assaults. Crucifix in hand, Father
San Agustin and Father Ducos calmly walked through many a hail of
bullets and many a flight of spears leading and encouraging their
half-savage converts in their resistance to these cruel oppressors.</p>
<p>Not to be out-done by either soldier or priest, Captain Malcampo, of
the Spanish Navy, drove his vessel, the <i>Constancia</i>, right up to
the Cotta of Pangalungan till her bowsprit touched the ramparts, then,
sword in hand, leading a company of boarders, and using the bowsprit as
a bridge, he carried the fort by assault, and put the garrison to the
sword.</p>
<p>The thirsty soil of Mindanao has drunk freely of Spanish blood, and
Pampango, Tagal, and Visaya have all worthily borne their part in this
long drawn-out crusade of the Cross against the Crescent.</p>
<p>But not alone the Moro sword and spear has delayed for so long the
conquest of Mindanao. Deadly fevers lurk in the lowlands, the swamps
and the creeks of that rich and fertile island.</p>
<p>The Moros appear impervious to the malaria. At all events they live
and thrive in, or in close proximity to, mangrove swamp and flooded
jungle. The Tagal or the Visaya is not immune, and some even resist an
attack of the terrible <i>perniciosa</i> less than a white man. I shall
never in my life forget the awful sights I witnessed in 1887 and 1892
when some native regiments returned to Manila from the war in Mindanao.
Any one who saw Shafter&rsquo;s army <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb364" href="#pb364" name="pb364">364</a>]</span>disembark on their
return from Cuba will understand me. Those who could march were mere
walking corpses, but the shrunken forms, the livid tint and the glassy
eyes of those who could not stand (and there were hundreds of them),
brought the horrors of mismanaged war to the onlooker like one of
Vereschagin&rsquo;s realistic masterpieces.</p>
<p>But as the slaughter of the Dervishes at Omdurman teaches, not even
the most dauntless bravery can prevail against modern weapons in the
hands of tolerably disciplined troops. The quick-firing gun, the
howitzer with shrapnell shell, the machine-gun and the magazine-rifle
must inevitably bring about the subjugation of every lowland population
not supplied with these dread engines of civilisation, and only the
hardy dwellers in Nature&rsquo;s loftiest fastnesses, the Himalayas or
the Andes, may hope to retain their independence in the future.</p>
<p>It is a <span class="corr" id="xd20e12308" title=
"Source: strlking">striking</span> instance of the irony of fate that,
just as modern weapons have turned the scale in favour of the Spaniards
in this long struggle, and brought the Moros within measurable distance
of subjection, when only one more blow required to be struck,
Spain&rsquo;s Oriental Empire should suddenly vanish in the smoke of
Dewey&rsquo;s guns, and her flag disappear for ever from battlements
where (except for the short interval of British occupation,
1762&ndash;3) it has proudly waved through storm and sunshine for three
hundred and twenty-eight years.</p>
<p>Such, however, is the case, and it now falls to the United States to
complete the task of centuries, to stretch out a protecting hand over
the Christian natives of Mindanao, and to suppress the last remains of
a slave-raiding system, as ruthless, as sanguinary and as devastating
as the annals of the world can show.</p>
<p>The Moros of Mindanao are divided into five groups or tribes;
Illanos, Sanguiles, Lutangas, Calibuganes, and Yacanes.</p>
<p>(18) The Moros Illanos, who are the most important and the most
dangerous community, are described fully later on. They inhabit the
country between the Bay of Iligan and Illana Bay, also round Lake
Lanao, the Rio Grande and Lake Liguan.</p>
<p>(19) The Moros Sanguiles live on the south coast from the Bay of
Sarangani to the River Kulut.</p>
<p>(20) The Moros Lutangas occupy the Island of Olutanga and parts of
the <span class="corr" id="xd20e12322" title=
"Source: adjacents">adjacent</span> coasts, all round the Bay of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>Dumanguilas and Maligay, and the eastern coast
of the Bay of Sibuguay.</p>
<p>(21) The Moros Calibuganes occupy the western coast of the Bay of
Sibuguay, they are also dotted along the outer coast of the Peninsula
as far as the Bay of Sindangan. They communicate by land across the
mountains.</p>
<p>(22) The Moros Yacanes occupy the western part of the Island of
Basilan, and the islands of the Tapul group.</p>
<p>(23) The Moros Samales are not inhabitants of Mindanao, but occupy
and dominate the Islands of Jolo, Tawi-tawi and most of the smaller
islands of those groups.</p>
<p>Physically, the Moro is a man built for the fatigues of war, whether
by sea or land.</p>
<p>His sinewy frame combines strength and agility, and the immense
development of the thorax gives him marvellous powers of endurance at
the oar or on the march.</p>
<p>Trained to arms from his earliest youth, he excels in the management
of the lance, the buckler and the sword. These weapons are his
inseparable companions: the typical Moro is never unarmed. He fights
equally well on foot, on horseback, in his fleet war canoe, or in the
water, for he swims like a fish and dives like a penguin.</p>
<p>Absolutely indifferent to bloodshed or suffering, he will take the
life of a slave or a stranger merely to try the keenness of a new
weapon. He will set one of his sons, a mere boy, to kill some
defenceless man, merely to get his hand in at slaughter.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e12341src" href="#xd20e12341" name=
"xd20e12341src">1</a> If for any reason he becomes disgusted with his
luck, or tired of life, he will shave off his eyebrows, dress himself
entirely in red, and taking the oath before his Pandit, run <i>amok</i>
in some Christian settlement, killing man, woman and child, till he is
shot down by the enraged townsmen.</p>
<p>Wanton destruction is his delight. After plundering and burning some
sea-coast town in Visayas or Luzon, they would take the trouble to cut
down the fruit trees, destroy the crops and everything else that they
could not carry away.</p>
<p>Yet, as they made annual raids, it would have appeared to be good
policy to leave the dwellings, the fruit trees, and the crops, in order
to tempt the natives to re-occupy the town and accumulate material for
subsequent plundering.</p>
<p>Commonly, very ignorant of his own religion, he is none <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>the
less a fanatic in its defence, and nourishes a traditional and fervent
hatred against the Christian, whether European or native.</p>
<p>Looking upon work as a disgrace, his scheme of life is simple; it
consists in making slaves of less war-like men, to work for him, and
taking their best looking girls for his concubines. His victims for
centuries, when not engaged on a piratical cruise, have been the
hill-tribes of the island, the Subanos, the Tagacaolos, the Vilanes,
the Manguangas and others.</p>
<p>Originally immigrants from Borneo, from Celehes or Ternate, with
some Arab admixture, the Moros have for centuries filled their harems
with the women of the hill-tribes, and with Tagal and Visayas and even
Spanish women, taken in their piratical excursions. They are now a very
mixed race, but retain all their war-like characteristics.</p>
<p>Cut off from the sea by the Spanish Naval forces, they turned with
greater energy than ever to the plundering and enslaving of their
neighbours, the hill-men. These poor creatures, living in small groups,
could offer but little resistance, and fell an easy prey. But now the
devoted labours of the Jesuit missionaries began to bear fruit. They
converted the hill-men, and gathered them together in larger
communities, better able to protect themselves, and although the Moros
sometimes burnt whole towns and slew all who resisted, carrying off the
women and children into slavery, yet, on the other hand, it often
happened that, getting notice of their approach, the Jesuits assembled
the fighting men of several towns, and, being provided with a few
fire-arms by the Government, they fell upon the Moros and utterly
routed them, driving them back to their own territory with great loss.
Of late years the Moros have found their slave-raids involve more
danger than they care to face, and even the powerful confederation of
Lake Lanao was, till the Spanish American war, hemmed in by chains of
forts and by Christian towns.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Moros of the Bay of Mayo.</p>
<p class="first xd20e1984">[<i>To face p.</i> 367.</p>
</div>
<p>But they have by no means entirely renounced their slave-raiding,
and in order to give a specific instance of their behaviour in recent
years, I will mention that on the 31st. of December, 1893, a party of
370 of them, under the Datto Ali, son to Datto Nua, accompanied by
seven other Dattos, all well armed, and forty of them carrying muskets
or rifles, and plenty of ammunition, made an unprovoked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>and
treacherous attack on Lepanto, a Christian village in the Mont&eacute;s
country, near the confluence of the Kulaman River with the Pulangui,
between the Locosocan and Salagalpon cataracts. This is the extreme
southern settlement of the Jesuits, and the nearest missionary resided
at Linabo, whilst the nearest garrison was at Bugcaon, some four
leagues distant.</p>
<p>The inhabitants, not being provided with fire-arms, sought safety in
flight, but the Moros captured fourteen of them. They profaned the
church, hacked to pieces the image of Our Saviour, and cut up a
painting of Our Lady of the Rosary, smashed the altar, and with the
d&eacute;bris, lighted a bonfire in the middle of the church, which,
strange to say, however, did not take fire.</p>
<p>They stole the cattle and horses, looted the village, and marched
off with their spoil and the fourteen captives.</p>
<p>When, however, they reached the ford on the River Mulita, five of
the Christians refused to proceed into slavery. These were the Datto
Mausalaya, another man named Masumbalan, and three women. They were all
put to death by the Moros and barbarously mutilated. The flesh was cut
from their bones, and it is said that the Moros consumed some of it,
and so terrified the other captives that they marched forward into
life-long slavery.</p>
<p>Had the converts in Lepanto been supplied with a few fire-arms, this
disaster would not have happened.</p>
<p>The Mindanao Moros commonly wear a bright coloured handkerchief as a
head-cloth or turban, a split shirt of Chinese pattern, wide trousers,
and gaudy sashes.</p>
<p>The young men shave their heads, but after marriage they let their
hair grow long.</p>
<p>The dattos, mandarines, and pandits usually cultivate a moustache,
others pluck out all the hair on the face. The poorer women commonly
dress in white and wear a jacket and a skirt coming down well below the
knee. The richer ones wear silks of the brightest colours.</p>
<p>A white turban or head-cloth is a sign of mourning.</p>
<p>The illustration shows a group of Moros of the East coast. They are
unarmed, unlike those of Lake Lanao.</p>
<p>The Moro noble takes great pride in his long descent, and in the
distinction gained in war by his ancestors. During the long hours of
their friendly meetings called <i>Bich&aacute;ras</i>, they relate to
each other tales of their ancestors&rsquo; heroism. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span></p>
<p>Their feudal system has been more or less copied by Subanos,
Manobos, Mont&eacute;ses and other hill-races. The <i>datto</i> or
mandarin is the feudal chief amongst all these, but the Moros have gone
a step further, and have instituted rajahs and sultans, although with
only a shadowy authority; for every important matter must come before
the council of dattos for approval.</p>
<p>They use titles similar to those of the Malays of Borneo and Johore.
Tuang, the head-man of a village; Cuano, a Justice of the Peace;
Lamudia, Nacuda and Timuay, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class judges; Gangalia, a
constable; Baguadato, a principal, or Cabeza; Maradiadina, eldest son
of a principal. A datto is known by the richness of his apparel and by
using gold buttons, and especially by always carrying a handkerchief in
his hand. He is usually followed by a slave carrying his siri-box.</p>
<p>Like the Malays, they call the heir of a rajah the Rajah-muda; the
nephew of a sultan uses the epithet Paduca; the son of a sultan calls
himself Majarasin, the pure or mighty.</p>
<p>Orang-Kaya, corresponds to a magnate; Cachil, to a prince of the
blood. The war-minister of a sultan is called the Datto Realao.</p>
<p>A principal priest is called a S&aacute;rif or sheriff; and an
ordinary priest a Pandita, or learned man.</p>
<p>The learning of these worthies is of the most rudimentary
description, and consists in being able to read the Koran in Arabic,
and to recite certain prayers which they often do not understand.</p>
<p>They have some wretched sheds for places of worship which they call
Langa. During the fast of Sanibayang, which lasts for seven days, they
are supposed to abstain from all nourishment. However, at midnight,
when they think their god may be napping, they indulge in a hurried
meal on the quiet. At the end of their week of abstinence they undergo
a purification by bathing, and indemnify themselves for their fasts by
several sumptuous banquets. They are forbidden to eat swine&rsquo;s
flesh, or drink spirituous liquors, but they are not at all strict in
their religion, and the savoury smell of roast pork has been known to
overcome their scruples.</p>
<p>They are very fond of smoking tobacco, and of chewing buyo; some
indulge in opium smoking.</p>
<p>Their amusements are gambling, cock-fighting, and combats of
buffaloes. Their slave-girls perform various <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>libidinous dances to the sound of the agun, or
brass gong, and the calintangang, a kind of harmonium of strips of
metal struck by a small drum-stick.</p>
<p>The dance called the Paujalay is usually performed at a marriage of
any importance, and the young dancers, clad in diaphanous garments,
strive to present their charms in the most alluring postures, for the
entertainment of the dattos and their guests.</p>
<p>They have also a war-dance called the Moro-moro, which is performed
by their most skilful and agile swordsmen, buckler on arm and
<i>campilan</i> in hand to the sound of martial music. It simulates a
combat, and the dancers spring sideways, backwards or forwards, and
cut, thrust, guard, or feint with surprising dexterity.</p>
<p>The Moros are polygamists in general, although the influence of the
Christian women taken as captives and sometimes married to their
captors, has, in many cases, succeeded in preventing their husbands
from taking a second wife. The cleverness and aptitude for business of
Christian Visayas, and Tagal women captives, has sometimes raised them
to the highest position in rank and wealth amongst the Moros; and few
of them would have returned to their former homes, even if an occasion
had offered. The custom of seizing girls for slaves and concubines
which has prevailed amongst the Moros for centuries, has of course had
the effect of encouraging sensuality, and the morals of Moro society
may be compared to those of a rabbit-warren.</p>
<p>The Moros do not always treat their slaves with cruelty, they rather
strive to attach them to their new home by giving them a female captive
or a slave-girl they have tired of, as a wife, assisting them to build
a house, and making their lot as easy as is compatible with getting
some work out of them.</p>
<p>But perhaps the greatest allurement to one of these slaves is when
his master takes him with him on a slave-raid, and gives him the
opportunity of securing some plunder, and perhaps a slave for
himself.</p>
<p>Once let him arrive at this stage, and his master need have no fear
of his absconding.</p>
<p>The Spaniards have for years refused to send back any slaves who
claim their protection, yet it has been remarked by Dr. Montano, and by
missionaries and Spanish military officers, that slaves have been
employed fishing or tilling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href=
"#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span>the ground near the Spanish
outposts, and only rarely would one step within the lines to obtain his
liberty.</p>
<p>If caught running away from their masters, the dattos, they are
sometimes put to death, or mutilated in a most cruel manner.</p>
<p>The famous Datto Utto, of the Rio Grande, is said to have stripped a
runaway slave naked and to have tied him to a tree, leaving him to be
stung to death by the mosquitos or devoured piecemeal by ants.</p>
<p>This same Datto Utto, towards the end of 1889, made himself so
objectionable to the Datto Abdul, one of his neighbours, that the
latter determined to place himself and his people under Spanish
protection. His village consisted of eighty houses and was situated on
the banks of Rio Grande.</p>
<p>Datto Abdul gave proofs of engineering skill, for he constructed
eighty rafts of bamboos, and placing a house upon each with all its
belongings, inhabitants and cattle, he floated his whole village
fifteen miles down the river and landed at Tumbao, establishing himself
under the protection of the fort.</p>
<p>The Datto Ayunan, who resides in the same neighbourhood, also came
over to the Spaniards, and learned to understand and speak Spanish very
fairly. He had at least three thousand followers, and in the fighting
on the Rio Grande in 1886&ndash;87 he took the field, supported the
Spanish forces against the other dattos, and rendered important
services.</p>
<p>Several other dattos and chiefs have submitted to the Spaniards; for
instance, the Sultan of Bolinson, who has settled at Lintago, near the
barracks of Maria Christina. In the district of Davao more than five
thousand Moros are living peacefully under Spanish rule.</p>
<p>The famous Datto Utto, who gave so much trouble, lost followers and
prestige, and now where the Moro King of Tamontaca held his court and
reigned in power and splendour on the Rio Grande, a Jesuit Orphan
Asylum, and Industrial School flourished [till the war caused it to be
abandoned], bringing up hundreds of children of both sexes, mostly
liberated slaves of the Moros, to honest handicrafts or agricultural
labour.</p>
<p>Amongst the Moros, the administration of justice is in the hands of
the dattos or of their nominees. Offences are punished by death,
corporal chastisement, or by fines. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb371" href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span></p>
<p>However, the customs of the country admit of an offended person
taking the law into his own hand. Thus he who surprises his wife in the
act of adultery may cut off one of her ears, shave her head, and
degrade her to be the slave of his concubines.</p>
<p>If he catches the co-respondent he may kill him (if he can).</p>
<p>A calumny not justified, is fined 15 dollars; a slight wound costs
the aggressor 5 dollars; a serious wound, 15 dollars, and the weapon
that did the mischief; a murder can be atoned by giving three to six
slaves.</p>
<p>Adultery incurs a fine of 60 dollars, and two slaves; or death, if
the fine is not paid.</p>
<p>He who insults a datto is condemned to death, unless he can pay 15
taels of gold, but he becomes a slave for life. The datto acting as
judge takes as his fee one-eighth of the fine he imposes.</p>
<p>A slave is considered to be worth from 15 to 30 dollars according to
his or her capabilities or appearance.</p>
<p>The dattos impose an annual tax on all their subjects whether Moros
or heathen. It is called the Pagdatto, and consists of a piece of cloth
called a Jabol, a bolo, and twenty gantas of paddy (equal to 10 gantas
of rice) from each married couple. A ganta equals two-thirds of a
gallon, so that the tax in rice would only be 6.6 gallons, a little
over &frac34; bushel.</p>
<p>Their language is a degraded Arabic with words from Malay, Chinese,
Visaya, Tagal, and some idioms of the hill-tribes.</p>
<p>Very few of them can read or write.</p>
<p>Their year is divided into 13 lunar months, and the days of the week
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Their era is the Hejira, like other Mahometans.</p>
<p>Their marriage customs are peculiar. When one of them takes a fancy
to a damsel, he sends his friend, of the highest rank, to the house of
the girl&rsquo;s father, to solicit her hand. The father consults the
girl, and if she is favourable he makes answer that the young man may
come for her. The would-be bridegroom then proceeds to the mosque and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>calls the <span class="corr" id="xd20e12540"
title="Source: Iman">Imam</span>, who goes through a form of prayers
with him, after which they proceed in company to the maiden&rsquo;s
house, followed by a slave bearing presents, and from the street call
out for leave to enter. The father appears at a window and invites them
in, but when about to enter, the male relations of the damsel simulate
an attack on the visitor, which he beats off, and throws them the
presents he has brought with him.</p>
<p>He then enters with the <span class="corr" id="xd20e12545" title=
"Source: Iman">Imam</span> and finds the lady of his desires reclining
upon cushions, and presents his respects to her. The priest then causes
her to rise and, taking hold of her head he twirls her round twice to
the right, then taking the hand of the man he places it on the forehead
of the girl, who immediately covers her face. The priest then retires,
leaving them alone. The bridegroom attempts to kiss and embrace the
bride, who defends herself with tooth and nail. She shrieks and runs,
and the bridegroom chases her round and round the room.</p>
<p>Presently the father appears, and assures the bridegroom that he may
take for granted the virginity of his daughter. The bridegroom then
leaves the house to make preparations for the wedding-feast, which
begins that night, and finishes on the third night, when the bride
takes off all the garments she has worn as a maid and dresses in
handsome robes provided by the bridegroom. At the end of the feast, the
emissary who first solicited her hand for his friend conducts her to
the house of the bridegroom, accompanied by the guests singing verses
allusive to the occasion, and cracking jokes more or less indecent.</p>
<p>Contrary to the custom in other countries, it is easier to get
divorced than to get married, for this is the privilege of the man, who
can repudiate his wife at any time.</p>
<p>They celebrate the baptism of their children, and the circumcision
of their boys, with feasts and entertainments. They fire off cannon and
lantacas on the death of a datto, and with all sorts of instruments
make a hideous discord in front of the house of death.</p>
<p>Professional wailers are employed, and the pandits go through many
days of long-winded prayer, for which they receive most ample fees.</p>

<p>They have regular cemeteries, and, after the burial, place on the
grave the head of a cock with a hot cinder on the top of it. I am quite
unable to explain what meaning is attached to this custom, but they are
soaked in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>all sorts of superstitions, and thoroughly
believe in amulets or talismen, as do the Tagals in their
Anting-Anting.</p>
<p>Owing to the multitude of slaves they possess, they make
considerable plantations of rice, maize, coffee, and cacao. They sell
the surplus of this produce to Chinamen or Visayas settled in the coast
towns, as also wax, gum, resin, jungle-produce, tortoise-shell,
mother-of-pearl shell, balate and cinnamon. It is estimated that they
sell produce to the value of a million dollars a year. They also employ
their slaves in washing the sands for gold, and, according to Nieto, in
mining for silver and other metal.</p>
<p>I have not seen this latter statement confirmed by any other
author.</p>
<p>Their industries are the forging of swords, cris, and lance-heads,
casting and boring their lantacas.</p>
<p>To bore these long guns they sink them in a pit<span class="corr"
id="xd20e12579" title="Not in source">,</span> ramming in the earth so
as to keep the piece in a truly vertical position. They then bore by
hand, two or four men walking round and turning the bit with
cross-bars. Some of these lantacas are worthy to be considered perfect
works of art, and are highly decorated. I have seen several
double-barrelled. (<i>See</i> Illustration.)</p>
<p>The Moro women employ their slaves in spinning and weaving. They
make excellent stuffs of cotton and of abaca, dyeing them various
colours with extracts of the woods grown in the country.</p>
<p>Their houses are large and spacious, and they live in a patriarchal
manner, master and mistress, concubines, children, and slaves with
their children, all jumbled together. They possess plenty of horses,
cattle, buffaloes, goats and poultry.</p>
<p>They use Spanish or Mexican silver coins, but most of their
transactions are by barter.</p>
<p>To wind up this description of the Moros of Mindanao, it must be
said of them that they are always ready to fight for the liberty of
enslaving other people, and that nothing but force can restrain them
from doing so. That they will not work themselves, and that as long as
their sultans, dattos, and pandits have a hold on them, they will keep
no engagements, respect no treaties, and continue to be in the future,
as they have always been in the past, a terror and a curse to all their
neighbours. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=

the high peaks of the cordillera. If a straight line be drawn on the
map from Nasipit, on the Bay of Butuan, to Glan, on the Gulf of
Sarangani, it will intersect their habitat which may extend from about
7&deg; 30&prime; to 8&deg; N. lat. I can learn nothing about their
manners and customs. They are reputed to be ferocious.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Chinese in Mindanao.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Chinese in Mindanao are almost entirely settled in
the coast towns, and are occupied in trade. They do not engage in
agriculture, but keep stores and sell to the civilised natives and to
the hill-men.</p>
<p>They understand that they need protection, and are equally ready to
make a present to the judge, to subscribe for a gilded altar for the
church, or to render service to the governor, in order to be on good
terms with the court, the priest, and the military.</p>
<p>Very few Chinese women come over, therefore the men have native
wives or concubines, and are begetting Chinese half-castes on an
extensive scale.</p>
<p>They are not averse to a little slave-dealing, and will casually buy
a boy or girl from slave-hunters, or will order such a slave as they
require from the slave-hunters, who then proceed to execute the order,
which probably involves the sacrifice of several lives.</p>
<p>Thus they will order a smart boy, or a pretty girl, of fifteen or
sixteen, and so forth.</p>
<p>Father Barrado, writing from Cotta-Bato, June 3rd, 1890,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375</a>]</span>relates that a boy of eight years of age was
purchased by a Chinaman for thirty dollars.</p>
<p>As soon as his master had brought him to the house, he fastened the
door, and being assisted by four other Chinamen, tied the boy&rsquo;s
hands and feet, and gagged him.</p>
<p>The four assistants then laid him out at full length on the ground,
face downwards, and held him firmly, whilst his master took a red-hot
marking-iron from the fire, and branded him on both thighs, just as if
he was marking a horse or a cow.</p>
<p>Luckily, the boy escaped from the house, and found refuge with
Father Barrado, who took charge of him, and administered a severe
reprimand to the brutal Chinaman.</p>
<p>The Chinamen abominably cheat all those who are unable to protect
themselves. Their business is based upon false weights and measures,
and on adulteration. In the end, they spoil every business they enter
upon, just as they have done the tea trade in their own country, and
the tobacco and indigo trade in the Philippines.</p>
<p>They require to be closely looked after, and should be made to pay
special taxes, which they can well afford.</p>
<p>Some of the Chinese become converts, not that their mean and sordid
souls are in any degree susceptible to the influence of the Christian
religion, but in order to obtain material advantages.</p>
<p>They hope to be favoured in business, and to be able to get a
Christian wife, which otherwise might not be easy; for although a
Visayas woman does not disdain a Chinaman, she would not care to marry
a heathen.</p>
<p>In any case, the Chinaman most likely remains a heathen at heart,
and if he returns to China he becomes a renegade. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The present condition of the island is most
lamentable. Nothing could be more dreadful; robbery, outrage and murder
are rampant. Every evil passion is let loose, and the labour of years
has been lost. Mindanao, which promised so well, has relapsed into
savagery, as the direct consequence of the Spanish-American war, and
the cession of the Archipelago to the United States.</p>
<p>It should be understood that Spain, far from drawing any profit from
Mindanao, has, on the contrary, expended annually considerable sums,
derived from the revenues of Luzon and Visayas, in maintaining a
squadron of gunboats to police the seas, and keep down piracy, in
building and garrisoning forts to suppress the slave-trade, and in
assisting the missionaries to attract the heathen, by providing them
with seeds, implements of husbandry, and with clothing, also in giving
them fire-arms and ammunition to protect themselves from the Moros.</p>
<p>Annuities were paid to friendly Moro dattos as rewards for services
rendered, or as compensation for the cession of some of their
rights.</p>
<p>The Moros have always been the great danger to the peace of the
island, as the Visayas have always been the mainstay of Spanish
authority.</p>
<p>Had it not been for the war with America, the Moros would have been,
by this time, completely subdued.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Lake Lanao: Seat of the Moro Power, according to
Nieto.</p>
<p class="first xd20e1984">[<i>To face p.</i> 377.</p>
</div>
<p>Even as it was, half the island was practically free from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>danger from them. If you draw a line on the map
from Cagayan de Misamis to the head of the Bay of Sarangani, it will
roughly divide the island into halves. The Moros who lived to the
eastward of this line were pacific, and some thousands of them had been
baptized, and had given up polygamy and slave-trading.</p>
<p>Had they risen in arms&mdash;which was not at all likely&mdash;they
could have been put down by the Visayas militia under the local
authorities.</p>
<p>To the west of this line, until quite lately, the Spanish garrisons
dotted along the banks of the Rio Grande from Polloc and Cotta-bato to
Piquit and Pinto, dominated the Moro dattos of that region, and nearly
joined hands with the forts and garrisons on the rivers running into
the Bay of Macajalar.</p>
<p>The only remaining seat of the Moro power was the country around
Lake Lanao, where the dattos had formed the Illana confederation to
resist the advances of the Christians.</p>
<p>This lake has never been surveyed, and no two maps agree on its
size, shape or position. It is, however, known to be very different
from the other large lakes in Mindanao, which are shallow, whilst this,
on the contrary, is deep; in some places, three or four fathoms will be
found close in shore. At L&uacute;gud and Tugana the banks are
steep.</p>
<p>There are five or six islands in it; the largest is called Nuza. It
is high and flat-topped, situated near the middle of the lake, and on
it are five hundred houses.</p>
<p>The length of the lake may be about 14 miles, and its greatest
breadth about the same.</p>
<p>There is a road all round it, reported to be in good condition for
vehicles, except at Taraca, where the ground is soft. This road may be
about fifty miles long, and is said to have houses on both sides of it
nearly all the way. The accompanying sketch, from D. Jos&eacute;
Nietos&rsquo; map, shows forty-three towns clustered round the lake,
but in reality it is only one vast town, and the names are those of
districts or parishes, each under the rule of a datto. The Sultan lives
at Taraca.</p>
<p>The land about the lake is very fertile, and is cultivated by the
slaves.</p>
<p>The produce is of excellent quality, and the Moros not only supply
themselves, but export annually about 1000 tons of rice, and 900 tons
of coffee. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span></p>
<p>The River Agus, which drains the lake, is not navigable.</p>
<p>Although it has a great body of water, the impetuosity of the
current, rushing amongst rocks, forms dangerous rapids.</p>
<p>The surface of the lake must be considerably above the
sea-level.</p>
<p>The approaches to the northern end of the lake on both sides of the
river were defended by many cottas, or forts. Most of those were taken
and destroyed by the Spanish forces in 1894&ndash;96, but they are now
probably being rebuilt.</p>
<p>Half-way between the lake and the Bay of Iligan stands Fort Weyler,
which had a strong garrison of infantry, cavalry, artillery and
engineers, and was impregnable to any Moro attack. To the south of the
lake, on the shores of Illana Bay, stand Forts Corcuera and Baras,
whilst to the westward, between Illana Bay and Panguil Bay, lie four
forts across the narrow isthmus called Alfonso XIII., Infanta Isabel,
Santas Paz, and Eulalia and Maria Cristina.</p>
<p>These, with the trocha, or military road of Tuc&uacute;ran, cut off
the Illano Moros from communication with their brethren of Sibuguey, or
with their former victims, the Subanos.</p>
<p>Further to the northward, Fort Almonte kept watch over the quondam
pirates of the Liangan River.</p>
<p>These forts and posts were garrisoned by nearly 3000 regular troops,
all natives, except the artillery (<i>see</i> List of Posts in
Mindanao, p. 386), and in addition a field force of several thousand
men, also of the regular army, was encamped at Ulama, Pantar, and other
places to the north of the lake, and three small steam-vessels had been
transported overland in sections, and launched upon the lake.</p>
<p>Thus everything was ready for the final blow, for the Moros were
completely hemmed in by Spanish garrisons or Jesuit <i lang=
"es">reducciones</i>; but the breaking out of the Tagal insurrection,
in 1896, obliged General Blanco to withdraw, not only the field army,
but to reduce the garrisons in order to hold Manila and Cavite until
the Peninsular troops could arrive.</p>
<p>Later on, the war between the United States and Spain, and the
immediate destruction of the Spanish naval forces by the American
squadron, caused the Spanish authorities to sink the flotilla in the
lake, to abandon all the posts on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379"
href="#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span>the north coast of Mindanao,
the trocha of Tuc&uacute;ran, and all the forts on the Rio Grande, and
to concentrate their whole force at Zamboanga, leaving the
recently-converted heathen and the missionaries to defend themselves
against the Moros as best they could.</p>
<p>The missionaries of the district of Cotta-bato have taken refuge in
Zamboanga, fearing to fall into the hands of the Moros, who would exact
a heavy ransom for their delivery. As for the hundreds of liberated
slave children, both girls and boys, who were gathered together under
the protection of the missionaries at the asylum of Tamontaca, they are
doubtless once more in the hands of the cruel Moros of Lake Lanao;
some, perhaps, have been sold by these wretches to the heathen tribes
for twenty or thirty dollars each, to be offered up as sacrifices to
Tag-busan, the god of war of the Manobos, or to Dewata, the sanguinary
house-god of the Guiangas.</p>
<p>The missionaries of the north of Mindanao were recalled by the
Father Superior to Manila; but in some of the towns the native converts
and Visayas have detained them by force, and keep a watch on them to
prevent their escape. They treat them well, and allow them to exercise
their ministry.</p>
<p>As there are no Moros in that part of the island, the missionaries
are not in danger, for they are much beloved by their converts, whose
only desire is to keep them amongst them.</p>
<p>The district of Davao has been, like other localities, the scene of
murder and pillage since the withdrawal of the Spanish authorities. At
midnight of February 6th, the bad characters and outlaws of the chief
town, under the leadership of Domingo Fernandez, a native of Zamboanga,
and formerly interpreter and writer in the office of the Governor of
Davao, rose in arms, and attacked the house of Don Bonifacio Quidato,
sub-lieutenant of the local militia. They cut his throat, and bayoneted
his wife as she lay in her bed. They then attacked all the well-to-do
people of the place, committing many barbarous acts, and plundering
their houses.</p>
<p>Most of the Spanish residents escaped from the town in a lorcha,
and, after a terrible voyage of sixteen days, suffering from hunger,
and undergoing many severe privations, arrived in Zamboanga more dead
than alive. The veteran missionary, Father Urios, and three other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>Spaniards, could not escape, and remained in the
power of the bandits.</p>
<p>This is only one instance of what is going on all over the island.
In the words of one who knows the country well, Mindanao has become a
seething hell, and is in a condition more dreadful than ever before in
historic times.</p>
<p>But amongst these various tribes, Christian or heathen, there is
said to be one subject, and one only, upon which they all agree. They
have combined to resist by force the American invasion. If it is
attempted to conquer them by force of arms, it will be a difficult, a
tedious, and a costly operation&mdash;a campaign far more sickly than
that now proceeding in the arable lands around Manila, where the ground
is hard, the country very level, and where field-guns can be taken
anywhere during the dry season. It is my belief that, if skilfully
handled, half the island&mdash;the eastern half&mdash;could be pacified
without war, although, no doubt, gangs of bandits would have to be
destroyed; but this could be done by the Visayas and the converts,
organised as a militia, and paid whilst on active service.</p>
<p>But this pacification requires the assistance of the missionaries.
They are not likely to give that assistance unless terms are made with
them, and one of those terms will surely be that they shall be allowed
to continue their beneficent work unhindered and unvexed.</p>
<p>So the United States Government is confronted with a dilemma. Either
they must shoot down the new Christians, to introduce and enforce
freedom of worship which the converts do not want, and cannot
understand, or they must negotiate with the Jesuits for them to use
their influence to pacify the island, and thus subject themselves to
the abuse and the outcry such a proceeding will bring upon them from
the divines and missionaries of Protestant sects, and from their
political opponents.</p>
<p>As for the western half of the island, a part may be pacified with
the help of the missionaries, but military operations on a considerable
scale will be required there sooner or later against the Moros of Lake
Lanao.</p>
<p>This would be a holy war, a war of humanity, and I would say to the
Americans: Look back on the deeds of your forefathers, on the days when
your infant navy covered itself with imperishable glory, when it curbed
the insolence of the Bashaw of Tripoli, the Bey of Tunis, and the Dey
of Algiers, teaching all Europe how to deal with Mediterranean
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>pirates. Inspire yourselves with the Spirit of
Decatur and his hero-comrades whose gallant deeds at Tripoli earned
Nelson&rsquo;s praise as being &ldquo;the most bold and daring act of
the age,&rdquo; and do not hesitate to break up this last community of
ex-pirates and murderous slave-hunters.</p>
<p>The Moros of Lake Lanao could be simultaneously attacked from north
and south. In 1894, the Spaniards attacked by the north, and
transported all their artillery and stores and their small steamers
built in sections, by paths on the eastern side of the River Agus. Some
of the Moros remained neutral in that campaign. Such were the Dattos of
Lumbayangin and Guimba. Their cottas were spared. The distance in a
straight line from the mouth of the Agus near Iligan to the lake is
fifteen miles.</p>
<p>The path winds a good deal, and the country is hilly, wooded on the
heights, and intersected by streams. There is a path on the west bank
of the Agus, the country there is more open, and a large part of it is
under cultivation. A good outfit of mountain-guns would be required on
this northern expedition.</p>
<p>The other attack could be made from the south, the forces landing at
Fort Baras, or at Lalabuan. From either of these places there is what
in the Philippines is called a road to Ganasi at the southern end of
the lake. The distance in a straight line is about twenty miles. The
two roads join at about half way, just before coming to the cotta of
Kurandangan in the Sultanate of Pu&aacute;las.</p>
<p>This road is reported to have no steep gradients, no boggy parts,
and no unfordable streams. The country is fairly open, as there is no
thick forest, but only scrub and <i>cogon</i>, or elephant grass. From
a description given by a Tagal who traversed this road, it appears to
be practicable for field artillery. The combined attack, north and
south, could be supported by an advance from the eastward of irregular
forces of the Mont&eacute;ses from the <i lang="es">reducciones</i> of
the Tagoloan, Sawaga and Malupati Rivers, if they were supplied with
arms and ammunition for this purpose.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we have here the usual three courses; the
fourth, to do nothing, and allow Moro and Christian to fight it out,
would be unworthy of the United States, or of any civilized
government.</p>
<p>1. Put a stop to slave-hunting and murdering by a military
expedition against the Moro Dattos.</p>
<p>2. Maintain garrisons to keep the peace and protect the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>missionaries and their converts and trust to
their efforts to gradually convert the Moros.</p>
<p>3. Arm all the Christian towns round about the Moros and organise
the men as local militia, so that they can protect themselves against
Moro aggression.</p>
<p>All these courses are expensive, the second less expensive than the
first, the third less expensive than the second.</p>
<p>However, if either the second or third course is adopted, it is very
probable that before long the first course would become imperative, for
the Moros are faithless and treacherous in the extreme, and no treaty
unsupported by bayonets has the least chance of being respected.</p>
<p>To adopt the second or third course, then, only amounts to putting
off the evil day.</p>
<p>The missionaries can be of the greatest service in pacifiying the
Moros whenever the power of the dattos is broken and when slavery can
be put an end to. The object of the expedition I have spoken of should
not be to exterminate the Moros, but merely to break the power of the
dattos and pandits, and to free their followers and slaves from their
yoke.</p>
<p>It is generally taken for granted that a Moro cannot be converted,
but this is not the case in Mindanao. Father Jaoquin Sancho, S.J.,
informs me that when the political power of the dattos has been
destroyed, their followers have been found ready to listen to the
teachings of the missionaries and beginning by sending their children
to school, then perhaps sanctioning the marriage of their daughters
with Christians, they have finally cast in their lot with the Roman
Catholic Church, not in scores, nor hundreds, but by thousands. He says
that his colleagues baptized in one year after 1892, in the district of
Davao alone, more than three thousand Mahometan Moros. He adds that
their religious receptivity is much greater than that of the heathen
tribes, that once baptized they remain fervent Christians, whilst the
Mandayas, Manobos, Mont&eacute;ses and other heathen are only too apt,
with or without reason, to slip away to the forests and mountains and
resume their nomadic life, their heathen orgies, and human
sacrifices.</p>
<p>I have already spoken of the success of the missionaries on the Rio
Grande and of their industrial and agricultural orphanage at
Tamontacca, where they were bringing up hundreds of children of both
sexes, mostly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span>liberated slaves of the Moros, to be useful
members of society. This noble institution occupied the very spot where
the former Moro Sultan of Tamontacca held his court.</p>
<p>Two or three more institutions like this, established at points a
few miles distant from Lake Lanao, and <i>protected from aggression</i>
on the part of the Moro, would gradually undermine the power of the
Dattos by affording an asylum to all fugitive slaves attempting to
escape from cruelties of their masters.</p>
<p>For years past the Spaniards have protected all slaves who have fled
to them from their masters. The Datto Utto applied to General Weyler to
restore to him forty-eight slaves who had taken refuge at a Spanish
fort on the Rio Grande, but Weyler refused, reminding the datto that he
had signed an engagement to keep no slaves, but only free labourers,
who had the right to fix their residence where they pleased.</p>
<p>I assume that no slaves who seek the shelter of the Stars and
Stripes will ever be sent back again into bondage.</p>
<p>As a guide to the strength of the expedition which will sooner or
later have to be sent against the Moros of Lake Lanao, I may say that
the total war strength of the Moros of Mindanao was estimated in 1894
at 19,000 fighting-men, 35 guns, 1896 Lantacas and 2167 muskets or
rifles. (<i>See</i> list, p. 387).</p>
<p>They have probably since then obtained a large supply of rifles and
ammunition. This traffic in arms should be at once stopped.</p>
<p>Swords and spears they have in abundance.</p>
<p>But of these 19,000 men many have submitted to the Spanish rule, or
have become allies of the Spaniards, like the Datto Ayunan, the Datto
Abdul, the Sultan of Bolinson and many others.</p>
<p>Probably 10,000 men would be the very utmost that the Moros of Lake
Lanao could bring on the field, and only a part of these would have
fire-arms, which they could have little skill in handling.</p>
<p>They would on no account give battle in the open, but would fight in
the bush, and desperately defend their cottas. They would not
concentrate their forces, for want of transport for their food supply;
besides, the nature of the country would prevent this. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span></p>
<p>They could not stop a flotilla from being launched on the lake and
from capturing the islands as a base of operations.</p>
<p>The flotilla would be operating on inside lines of communication. It
could threaten one side of the lake, and in less than two hours be
landing troops on the opposite side.</p>
<p>In fact, with a moderate force, their subjugation would not be so
difficult as has often been supposed.</p>
<p>It should be made clear to the S&aacute;copes and to the slaves that
the war is waged against the Sultans and Dattos, that the people would
have their lives and property and the free exercise of their religion
guaranteed to them, and that the adults should be exempt from taxation
and conscription for the rest of their lives or for a term of years.
Then the resistance would soon slacken, and the sultans and dattos
might be captured. Those who would not conform to the new condition of
things might be allowed to emigrate to Borneo or elsewhere, but their
subjects and slaves should by no means be allowed to go with them, for
they will soon become useful agriculturists and good Christians, and
Mindanao cannot spare them.</p>
<p>The question of slavery, more especially of slave-concubines, will
require delicate handling, but by adopting a conciliatory but firm
policy, this curse may gradually be got rid of without causing
disturbance or bloodshed. Cranks and faddists should not be allowed to
handle this question, but it should be placed in the hands of some one
well versed in human nature, and a true friend of freedom.</p>
<p>The wise policy of the British authorities in Zanzibar and Pemba is
well worthy of imitation.</p>
<p>As happens in Africa, the greatest impediment to the conversion of
the heathen polygamist is the obligation to renounce all his wives but
one. This is a sore trial, more especially when they have paid a good
price for them, or if they are good cooks.</p>
<p>Father Urios having persuaded a Manobo, who wished to be baptized,
to do this, the man said to him: &ldquo;Of my two wives I have decided
to keep the elder, but I make a great sacrifice in separating from the
other, for I had so much trouble to obtain her. Her father would only
give her to me in exchange for fifteen slaves. As I did not possess
them, I was obliged to take the field against the timid tribes in an
unknown country, and to capture these <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb385" href="#pb385" name="pb385">385</a>]</span>fifteen slaves. I was
obliged to fight often, and to kill more than thirty men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The illustration represents a scene from the labours of Father
Gisbert amongst the Bagobos. He is exhorting a blood-stained old datto
and his wives and followers to abandon their human sacrifices,
exhibiting to them the image of the crucified Redeemer, whose followers
he urges them to become.</p>
<p>As regards the maintenance of the missions, I do not for one moment
doubt that the liberality of the Roman Catholics of the United States
is quite equal to the needs of the pioneers of civilisation, who have
laboured with such remarkable success.</p>
<p>Altogether the Jesuits administered the spiritual, and some of the
temporal affairs of 200,000 Christians in Mindanao.</p>
<p>They educated the young, taught them handicrafts, attended to the
sick, consoled the afflicted, reconciled those at variance, explored
the country, encouraged agriculture, built churches, laid out roads,
and assisted the Administration. Finally, when bands of slave-hunting,
murdering Moros swept down like wolves on their flocks, they placed
themselves at the head of their ill-armed parishioners and led them
into battle against a ferocious enemy who gives no quarter, with the
calmness of men who, long before, had devoted their lives to the
Master&rsquo;s cause, to whom nothing in this world is of any
consequence except the advancement of the Faith and the performance of
duty.</p>
<p>They received very meagre monetary assistance from the Spanish
Government, and had to depend greatly upon the pious offerings of the
devout in Barcelona and in Madrid. It is to be feared that these
subscriptions will now fall off as Spain has lost the islands; if so,
it is all the more incumbent upon the Roman Catholics of America to
find the means of continuing the good work.</p>
<p>I feel sure that this will be so&mdash;Christian charity will not
fail, and the missions will be maintained.</p>
<p>For their devotion and zeal, I beg to offer the Jesuit missionaries
my profound respect and my earnest wishes for their welfare under the
Stars and Stripes.</p>
<p>To my mind, they realise very closely the ideal of what a Christian
missionary should be. Although a Protestant born and bred, I see in
that no reason to close my eyes to their obvious merit, nor to seek to
be-little the great good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href=
"#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>they have done in Mindanao. Far
from doing so, I wish to state my conviction that the easiest, the
best, and the most humane way of pacifying Mindanao is by utilising the
powerful influence of the Jesuit missionaries with their flocks, and
this before it is too late, before the populations have had time to
completely forget the Christian teaching, and to entirely relapse into
barbarism.</p>

Fundamental Problem,&rsquo; by a Spaniard long resident in those
islands, published in Madrid, 1891, by D. Luis Aguado. The pamphlet
itself is a violent attack on Rizal and those who sympathised with him,
and holds out as the only remedy against insurrection the encouragement
of Spanish immigration on an extensive scale. <span class=

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
